“Thank you, sir,” said Mr. Giles. “Misses wished some ale to be given out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir, and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among ’em here.” Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr. Giles’s condescension. Mr. Giles looked round with a patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly, he would never desert them. “How is the patient tonight, sir?” asked Giles. “So-so”; returned the doctor. “I am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there, Mr. Giles.” “I hope you don’t mean to say, sir,” said Mr. Giles, trembling, “that he’s going to die. If I thought it, I should never be happy again. I wouldn’t cut a boy off: no, not even Brittles here; not for all the plate in the county, sir.” “That’s not the point,” said the doctor, mysteriously. “Mr. Giles, are you a Protestant?” “Yes, sir, I hope so,” faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale. “And what are _you_, boy?” said the doctor, turning sharply upon Brittles.
