home.’ ‘There is one thing to be said of it,’ Louisa repeated in her former curious tone; ‘it will be getting away from home. Yes.’ ‘Not but what I shall be very unwilling, both to leave you, Loo, and to leave you here. But I must go, you know, whether I like it or not; and I had better go where I can take with me some advantage of your influence, than where I should lose it altogether.

What do you see in it? Not a circus?’ ‘I don’t see anything in it, Tom, particularly. But since I have been looking at it, I have been wondering about you and me, grown up.’ ‘Wondering again!’ said Tom. ‘I have such unmanageable thoughts,’ returned his sister, ‘that they _will_ wonder.’
