Stephen Blackpool bent his attentive face—his face, which, like the faces of many of his order, by dint of long working with eyes and hands in the midst of a prodigious noise, had acquired the concentrated look with which we are familiar in the countenances of the deaf—the better to hear what she asked him. ‘Pray, sir,’ said the old woman, ‘didn’t I see you come out of that gentleman’s house?’ pointing back to Mr. Bounderby’s. ‘I believe it was you, unless I have had the bad luck to mistake the person in following?’ ‘Yes, missus,’ returned Stephen, ‘it were me.’ ‘Have you—you’ll excuse an old woman’s curiosity—have you seen the gentleman?’ ‘Yes, missus.’ ‘And how did he look, sir? Was he portly, bold, outspoken, and hearty?’ As she straightened her own figure, and held up her head in adapting her action to her words, the idea crossed Stephen that he had seen this old woman before, and had not quite liked her. ‘O yes,’ he returned, observing her more attentively, ‘he were all that.’ ‘And healthy,’ said the old woman, ‘as the fresh wind?’ ‘Yes,’ returned Stephen. ‘He were ett’n and drinking—as large and as loud as a Hummobee.’
