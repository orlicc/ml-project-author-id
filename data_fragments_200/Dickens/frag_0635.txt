Ha! ha! you’re a brave boy, Oliver.” The Jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding. “Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?” said the Jew, laying his hand upon it after a short pause. “Yes, sir,” replied Oliver. “Ah!” said the Jew, turning rather pale. “They—they’re mine, Oliver; my little property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks call me a miser, my dear.
