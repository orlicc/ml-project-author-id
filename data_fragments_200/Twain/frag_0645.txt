it. And always coming to school or when we’re going home, you’re to walk with me, when there ain’t anybody looking—and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because that’s the way you do when you’re engaged.” “It’s so nice. I never heard of it before.” “Oh, it’s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence—” The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused. “Oh, Tom! Then I ain’t the first you’ve ever been engaged to!” The child began to cry. Tom said: “Oh, don’t cry, Becky, I don’t care for her any more.” “Yes, you do, Tom—you know you do.” Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping she would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong.
