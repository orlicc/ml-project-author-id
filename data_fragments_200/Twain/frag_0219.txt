over this thing, and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind. When we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes a-running, and says: “Mars Jawge, if you’ll come down into de swamp I’ll show you a whole stack o’ water-moccasins.” Thinks I, that’s mighty curious; he said that yesterday.

I’s seed ’m befo’; I don’t k’yer to see ’em no mo’.” Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid him.
