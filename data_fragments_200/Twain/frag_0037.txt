some for me?” “Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in, last night—over a hundred and fifty dollars. Quite a fortune for you. You had better let me invest it along with your six thousand, because if you take it you’ll spend it.” “No, sir,” I says, “I don’t want to spend it. I don’t want it at all—nor the six thousand, nuther. I want you to take it; I want to give it to you—the six thousand and all.” He looked surprised. He couldn’t seem to make it out. He says: “Why, what can you mean, my boy?” I says, “Don’t you ask me no questions about it, please. You’ll take it—won’t you?” He says: “Well, I’m puzzled. Is something the matter?” “Please take it,” says I, “and don’t ask me nothing—then I won’t have to tell no lies.” He studied a while, and then he says: “Oho-o! I think I see. You want to _sell_ all your property to me—not give it. That’s the correct idea.” Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says: “There; you see it says ‘for a consideration.’ That means I have bought it of you and paid you for it.
