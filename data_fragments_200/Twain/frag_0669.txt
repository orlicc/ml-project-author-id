with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you anyway, and blab if they get in a huff—but there orter be writing ’bout a big thing like this. And blood.” Tom’s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful; the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it. He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a little fragment of “red keel” out of his pocket, got the moon on his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes. “Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.” Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom’s facility in writing, and the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said: “Hold on! Don’t do that. A pin’s brass. It might have verdigrease on it.” “What’s verdigrease?” “It’s p’ison. That’s what it is. You just swaller some of it once—you’ll see.”
