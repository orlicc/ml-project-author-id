Poor thing—does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here, don’t you, Huck?

Go ’long home and get laughed at. Oh, you’re a nice pirate. Huck and me ain’t crybabies. We’ll stay, won’t we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get along without him, per’aps.” But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly on with his dressing.

Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the Illinois shore. Tom’s heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck.
