him, Huck. My, he’s pretty stiff. Where’d you get him?” “Bought him off’n a boy.” “What did you give?” “I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.” “Where’d you get the blue ticket?” “Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.” “Say—what is dead cats good for, Huck?” “Good for? Cure warts with.” “No! Is that so? I know something that’s better.” “I bet you don’t. What is it?” “Why, spunk-water.” “Spunk-water! I wouldn’t give a dern for spunk-water.” “You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? D’you ever try it?” “No, I hain’t. But Bob Tanner did.” “Who told you so!” “Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the nigger told me. There now!” “Well, what of it? They’ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I don’t know _him_. But I never see a nigger that _wouldn’t_ lie. Shucks! Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.” “Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was.” “In the daytime?” “Certainly.” “With his face to the stump?”
