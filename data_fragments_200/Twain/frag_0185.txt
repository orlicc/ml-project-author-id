night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend. I went off in the canoe to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and says: “Mister, is that town Cairo?” “Cairo? no. You must be a blame’ fool.” “What town is it, mister?” “If you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here botherin’ around me for about a half a minute longer you’ll get something you won’t want.” I paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned. We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it was high ground, so I didn’t go. No high ground about Cairo, Jim said. I had forgot it. We laid up for the day on a tow-head tolerable close to the left-hand bank. I begun to suspicion something. So did Jim. I says: “Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.” He says: “Doan’ le’s talk about it, Huck. Po’ niggers can’t have no luck.
