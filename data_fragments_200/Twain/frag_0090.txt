was most about starved. Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By-and-by Jim says: “But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat ’uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn’t you?” Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom Sawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says: “How do you come to be here, Jim, and how’d you get here?” He looked pretty uneasy, and didn’t say nothing for a minute. Then he says: “Maybe I better not tell.” “Why, Jim?” “Well, dey’s reasons. But you wouldn’ tell on me ef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?” “Blamed if I would, Jim.” “Well, I b’lieve you, Huck. I—I _run off_.” “Jim!” “But mind, you said you wouldn’ tell—you know you said you wouldn’ tell, Huck.” “Well, I did. I said I wouldn’t, and I’ll stick to it. Honest _injun_, I will. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum—but that don’t make no difference. I ain’t a-going to tell, and I ain’t a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le’s know all about it.”
