I’ll count ’m again.” So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she says: “Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther’s _ten_ now!” and she looked huffy and bothered both. But Tom says: “Why, Aunty, _I_ don’t think there’s ten.” “You numskull, didn’t you see me _count_ ’m?” “I know, but—” “Well, I’ll count ’m _again_.” So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time. Well, she _was_ in a tearing way—just a-trembling all over, she was so mad. But she counted and counted till she got that addled she’d start to count in the _basket_ for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they come out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west; and she said cle’r out and let her have some peace, and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she’d skin us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along with her shingle nail, before noon.
