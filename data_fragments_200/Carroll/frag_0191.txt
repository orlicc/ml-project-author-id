This tells us that there is _nothing_ in the North Half; that is, that the North Half is _empty_; that is, that the North-West Cell and the North-East Cell are both of them _empty_. And this we can represent by placing _two Grey_ Counters in the North Half, one in each Cell. .-------. |( )|( )| |---|---| | | | .-------.
