know that, if the Proposition "Some xy are z" be true, the same result follows. But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of them _must_ be true. Hence this result is _always_ true: i.e. the Proposition "Some x are y" is _always_ true! _Quod est absurdum._ (See Note (A), p. 195). We see, then, that the supposition "_I_ asserts" necessarily leads to "_A_ asserts, but _E_ does not". And this is the _first_ of the various views that may conceivably be held. Next, let us suppose that _I_ does _not_ "assert." And, along with this, let us take the supposition that _E_ _does_ "assert." Hence the Proposition "No x are y" means "Some x exist, and none of them are y": i.e. "_all_ of them are _not_-y," which is a Proposition in _A_. We also know, of course, that the Proposition "All x are not-y" proves "No x are y." Now two Propositions, each of which proves the other, are _equivalent_. Hence every Proposition in _A_ is equivalent to one in _E_, and therefore "_asserts_". Hence our _second_ conceivable view is "_E_ and _A_ assert, but _I_ does not." This view does not seen to involve
