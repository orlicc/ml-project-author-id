_North_ Half, is also in the _West_ Half. Hence there is _nothing_ in the space _common_ to them, that is, in the _North-West Cell_. Hence the North-West Cell is _empty_. And this we can represent by placing a _Grey_ Counter in it. .-------. |( )| | |---|---| | | | .-------. [In the "books" example, this Proposition would be "No old books are English".] Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions "No x are y'", and "No x' are y", and "No x' are y'". [The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the "books" example, these three Propositions would be "No old books are foreign", &c.] Let us take, next, the Proposition "No y are x". This tells us that no Thing, in the _West_ Half, is also in the _North_ Half. Hence there is _nothing_ in the space _common_ to them, that is, in the _North-West Cell_. That is, the North-West Cell is _empty_. And this we can represent by placing a _Grey_ Counter in it. .-------. |( )| | |---|---| | | | .-------. [In the "books" example, this Proposition would be "No English books are old".] Similarly we may represent the three similar
