(3) "No x' are m'; All m are y". Here we begin by breaking up the Second into the two Propositions to which it is equivalent. Thus we have _three_ Propositions to represent, viz.-- (1) "No x' are m'; (2) Some m are y; (3) No m are y'". These we will take in the order 1, 3, 2. First we take No. (1), viz. "No x' are m'". This gives us Diagram a. pg052 Adding to this, No. (3), viz. "No m are y'", we get Diagram b. This time the "I", representing No. (2), viz. "Some m are y," has to sit on the fence, as there is no "O" to order it off! This gives us Diagram c. a b c .---------------. .---------------. .---------------. | | | | | | |
