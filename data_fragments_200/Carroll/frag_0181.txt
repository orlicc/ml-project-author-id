which, being Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. that _some existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once. Hence it is to be understood as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is _Real_. [Thus, the Proposition "Some rich men are invalids" is to be understood as asserting that _some existing Things_ are "rich invalids". Hence it implies that _each_ of the two Classes, "rich men" and "invalids", taken by itself, is _Real_.] A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "No", is henceforward to be understood as asserting that there are _no existing Things_ which, being Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. that _no existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once. But this implies nothing as to the _Reality_ of either Term taken by itself. [Thus, the Proposition "No mermaids are milliners" is to be understood as asserting that _no existing Things_ are "mermaid-milliners". But this implies nothing as to the _Reality_, or the _Unreality_, of either of the two Classes, "mermaids" and "milliners", taken by itself. In this case as it happens, the Subject is _Imaginary_, and the Predicate _Real_.] A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All",
