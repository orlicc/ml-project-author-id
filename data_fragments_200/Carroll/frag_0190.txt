Reader can supply for himself, and shall write them as "Some x exist" or "No x are y". [Note that the word "Things" is here used with a special meaning, as explained at p. 23.] A Proposition, containing only _one_ of the Letters used as Symbols for Attributes, is said to be '=Uniliteral='. [For example, "Some x exist", "No y' exist", &c.] A Proposition, containing _two_ Letters, is said to be ='Biliteral'=. [For example, "Some xy' exist", "No x' are y", &c.] A Proposition is said to be '=in terms of=' the Letters it contains, whether with or without accents. [Thus, "Some xy' exist", "No x' are y", &c., are said to be _in terms of_ x and y.] pg028 Sec. 2. _Representation of Propositions of Existence._ Let us take, first, the Proposition "Some x exist". [Note that this Proposition is (as explained at p. 12) equivalent to "Some existing Things are x-Things."] This tells us that there is at least _one_ Thing in the North Half; that is, that the North Half is _occupied_. And this we can evidently represent by placing a _Red_ Counter (here represented by a _dotted_ circle) on the partition which divides the North Half.
