to dispense with the Biliteral Diagram, and to read off the result from the Triliteral Diagram itself. To _transfer_ the information, observe the following Rules:-- (1) Examine the N.W. Quarter of the Triliteral Diagram. (2) If it contains a "I", in _either_ Cell, it is certainly _occupied_, and you may mark the N.W. Quarter of the Biliteral Diagram with a "I". (3) If it contains _two_ "O"s, one in _each_ Cell, it is certainly _empty_, and you may mark the N.W. Quarter of the Biliteral Diagram with a "O". pg054 (4) Deal in the same way with the N.E., the S.W., and the S.E. Quarter. [Let us take, as examples, the results of the four Examples worked in the previous Chapters. (1) .---------------. |(O) | (O)| | .---|---. | | | |(O)| | |---|---|---|---| | | |(O)| | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------. In the N.W. Quarter, only _one_ of the two Cells is marked as _empty_: so we do not know whether the N.W. Quarter of the Biliteral Diagram is _occupied_ or _empty_: so we cannot mark it. .-------. | |(O)| |---|---| | | | .-------. In the N.E. Quarter, we find _two_ "O"s: so _this_ Quarter
