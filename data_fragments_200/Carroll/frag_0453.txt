as follows:-- With regard to the relationship existing between the Class 'xy' and the two Classes 'z' and 'not-z', there are _four_ conceivable states of things, viz. (1) Some xy are z, and some are not-z; (2) " " none " (3) No xy " some " (4) " " none " Of these four, No. (2) is equivalent to "All xy are z", No. (3) is equivalent to "All xy are not-z", and No. (4) is equivalent to "No xy exist." Now it is quite undeniable that, of these _four_ states of things, each is, _a priori_, _possible_, some _one must_ be true, and the other three _must_ be false. Hence the Contradictory to (2) is "Either (1) or (3) or (4) is true." Now the assertion "Either (1) or (3) is true" is equivalent to "Some xy are not-z"; and the assertion "(4) is true" is equivalent to "No xy exist." Hence the Contradictory to "All xy are z" may be expressed as the Alternative Proposition "Either some xy are not-z, or no xy exist," but _not_ as the Categorical Proposition "Some y are not-z." pg196 (B) [See p. 171, at end of Section 2.] There are yet
