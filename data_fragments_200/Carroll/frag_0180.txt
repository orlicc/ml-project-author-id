Evidently we need to be told that _none_ of them are in the Class "_poor_ men".] Hence a Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", is a _Double_ Proposition, and is '=equivalent=' to (i.e. gives the same information as) the _two_ Propositions (1) "_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate"; (2) "_No_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of the Predicate". [Thus, the Proposition "_All_ bankers are rich men" is a _Double_ Proposition, and is equivalent to the _two_ Propositions (1) "_Some_ bankers are rich men"; (2) "_No_ bankers are _poor_ men".] pg019 Sec. 4. _What is implied, in a Proposition of Relation, as to the Reality of its Terms?_ Note that the rules, here laid down, are _arbitrary_, and only apply to Part I of my "Symbolic Logic." A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "Some", is henceforward to be understood as asserting that there are _some existing Things_,
