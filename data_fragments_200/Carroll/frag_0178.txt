This evidently contains, as a _part_ of what it tells us, the smaller Proposition "_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate". [Thus, the Proposition "_All_ bankers are rich men" evidently contains the smaller Proposition "_Some_ bankers are rich men".] The question now arises "What is the _rest_ of the information which this Proposition gives us?" In order to answer this question, let us begin with the smaller Proposition, "_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate," and suppose that this is _all_ we have been told; and let us proceed to inquire what _else_ we need to be told, in order to know that "_All_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate". [Thus, we may suppose that the Proposition "_Some_ bankers are rich men" is all the information we possess; and we may proceed to inquire what _other_ Proposition needs to be added to it, in order to make up the entire Proposition "_All_ bankers are rich men".] Let us also suppose that the 'Univ.'
