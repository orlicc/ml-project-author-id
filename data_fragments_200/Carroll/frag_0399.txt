_Teachers_, into whose hands this book may fall, in order that they may thoroughly understand what my Symbolic Method _is_, and in what respects it differs from the many other Methods already published. These matters are as follows:-- The "Existential Import" of Propositions. The use of "is-not" (or "are-not") as a Copula. The theory "two Negative Premisses prove nothing." Euler's Method of Diagrams. Venn's Method of Diagrams. My Method of Diagrams. The Solution of a Syllogism by various Methods. My Method of treating Syllogisms and Sorites. Some account of Parts II, III. Sec. 2. _The "Existential Import" of Propositions._ The writers, and editors, of the Logical text-books which run in the ordinary grooves----to whom I shall hereafter refer by the (I hope inoffensive) title "The Logicians"----take, on this subject, what seems to me to be a more humble position than is at all necessary. They speak of the Copula of a Proposition "with bated breath", almost as if it were a living, conscious Entity, capable of declaring for itself what it chose to mean, and that we, poor human creatures, had nothing to do but to ascertain _what_ was its sovereign will and pleasure, and submit to it. pg166 In
