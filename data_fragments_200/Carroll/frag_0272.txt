Now, if we agree to _mark_ m and m' as eliminated, and to read the two expressions together, as if they were written in one, the two Premisses will then exactly represent the _Conclusion_, and we need not write it out separately. Let us agree to mark the eliminated letters by _underscoring_ them, putting a _single_ score under the _first_, and a _double_ one under the _second_. The two Premisses now become xm_{0} + ym'_{0} - = which we read as "xy_{0}". In copying out the Premisses for underscoring, it will be convenient to _omit all subscripts_. As to the "0's" we may always _suppose_ them written, and, as to the "1's", we are not concerned to know _which_ Terms are asserted to _exist_, except those which appear in the
