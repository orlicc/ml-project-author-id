they assert, when combined, more than they do when taken separately. Hence the _third_ (and last) of the conceivable views is that neither _I_, nor _E_, nor _A_, "asserts". The advocates of this third view would interpret the Proposition "Some x are y" to mean "If there _were_ any x in existence, some of them _would_ be y"; and so with _E_ and _A_. It admits of proof that this view, as regards _A_, conflicts with the accepted facts of Logic. Let us take the Syllogism _Darapti_, which is universally accepted as valid. Its form is "All m are x; All m are y. .'. Some y are x". pg169 This they would interpret as follows:-- "If there were any m in existence, all of them would be x; If there were any m in existence, all of them would be y. .'. If there were any y in existence, some of them would be x". That this Conclusion does _not_ follow has been so briefly and clearly explained by Mr. Keynes (in his "Formal Logic", dated 1894, pp. 356, 357), that I prefer to quote his words:-- "_Let no proposition imply the existence either of its subject or of
