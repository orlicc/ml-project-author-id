the larger of the two? For the purposes of Symbolic Logic, it is so _much_ the most convenient plan to regard the two sub-divisions, produced by Dichotomy, on the _same_ footing, and to say, of any Thing, either that it "is" in the one, or that it "is" in the other, that I do not think any Reader of this book is likely to demur to my adopting that course. pg173 Sec. 4. _The theory that "two Negative Premisses prove nothing"._ This I consider to be _another_ craze of "The Logicians", fully as morbid as their dread of a negative Attribute. It is, perhaps, best refuted by the method of _Instantia Contraria_. Take the following Pairs of Premisses:-- "None of my boys are conceited; None of my girls are greedy". "None of my boys are clever; None but a clever boy could solve this problem". "None of my boys are learned; Some of my boys are not choristers". (This last Proposition is, in _my_ system, an _affirmative_ one, since I should read it "are not-choristers"; but, in dealing with "The Logicians," I may fairly treat it as a _negative_ one, since _they_ would read it "are-not choristers".)
