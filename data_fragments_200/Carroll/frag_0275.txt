find that a has been so given in No. 3. So we add this fact to the Conclusion, which now stands as > e'a_{0} + a_{1}, _i.e._ > a_{1}e'_{0}; i.e. "All a are e." If the Reader has faithfully obeyed the above directions, his written solution will now stand as follows:-- 1 2 3 4 k_{1}l'_{0} + dh'_{0} + a_{1}c_{0} + b_{1}e'_{0} + 5 6 7 k'h_{0} + b'l_{0} + d'_{1}c'_{0} 1 5 2 6 4 7 3 kl' + k'h + dh' + b'l + be' + d'c' + ac -- = - -= - = = = - = > e'a_{0} + a_{1} _i.e._ > a_{1}e'_{0}; _i.e._ "All a are e." pg093 The Reader should now take a second piece of paper, and copy the Data only, and try to work out the solution for himself, beginning with some other Premiss. If he fails to bring out the Conclusion a_{1}e'_{0}, I would advise him to take a third piece of paper, and _begin again_!] I will now work out, in its briefest form, a Sorites of 5 Premisses, to serve as a model for the Reader to imitate in working examples. (1) "I greatly value everything that John
