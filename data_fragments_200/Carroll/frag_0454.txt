One is, that the Proposition "some x are y" is to be interpreted, neither as "Some x _exist_ and are y", nor yet as "If there _were_ any x in existence, some of them _would_ be y", but merely as "Some x _can be_ y; i.e. the Attributes x and y are _compatible_". On _this_ theory, there would be nothing offensive in my telling my friend Jones "Some of your brothers are swindlers"; since, if he indignantly retorted "What do you _mean_ by such insulting language, you scoundrel?", I should calmly reply "I merely mean that the thing is _conceivable_----that some of your brothers _might possibly_ be swindlers". But it may well be doubted whether such an explanation would _entirely_ appease the wrath of Jones! Another view is, that the Proposition "All x are y" _sometimes_ implies the actual _existence_ of x, and _sometimes_ does _not_ imply it; and that we cannot tell, without having it in _concrete_ form, _which_ interpretation we are to give to it. _This_ view is, I think, strongly supported by common usage; and it
