contains (see Sec. 3) a similar Proposition beginning with "Some". Hence it is to be understood as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is _Real_. [Thus, the Proposition "All hyaenas are savage animals" contains the Proposition "Some hyaenas are savage animals". Hence it implies that _each_ of the two Classes, "hyaenas" and "savage animals", taken by itself, is _Real_.] pg020 Sec. 5. _Translation of a Proposition of Relation into one or more Propositions of Existence._ We have seen that a Proposition of Relation, beginning with "Some," asserts that _some existing Things_, being Members of its Subject, are _also_ Members of its Predicate. Hence, it asserts that some existing Things are Members of _both_; i.e. it asserts that some existing Things are Members of the Class of Things which have _all_ the Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate. Hence, to translate it into a Proposition of Existence, we take "existing Things" as the new _Subject_, and Things, which have _all_ the Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate, as the new Predicate. Similarly for a Proposition of Relation beginning with "No". A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", is (as shown in Sec. 3) equivalent to _two_ Propositions, one
