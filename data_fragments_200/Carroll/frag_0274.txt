or h'. Looking along the row, we fix on No. 2, and tack it on. Now these 3 Nullities are really equivalent to (l'h + dh'), in which h and h' must be eliminated, and what remains taken as one expression. So we _underscore_ them. The result reads as l'd. We now want a Premiss containing l or d'. No. 6 will do. These 4 Nullities are really equivalent to (l'd + b'l). So we underscore l' and l. The result reads as db'. We now want a Premiss containing d' or b. No. 4 will do. Here we underscore b' and b. The result reads as de'. We now want a Premiss containing d' or e. No. 7 will do. Here we underscore d and d'. The result reads as c'e'. We now want a Premiss containing c or e. No. 3 will do--in fact _must_ do, as it is the only one left. Here we underscore c' and c; and, as the whole thing now reads as e'a, we tack on e'a_{0} as the _Conclusion_, with a >. We now look along the row of Data, to see whether e' or a has been given as _existent_. We
