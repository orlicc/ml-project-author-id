But I may as well take this opportunity of describing the more complex ones which will appear in Part II. pg177 For _four_ letters (which I call a, b, c, d) I use this Diagram; assigning the North Half to a (and of course the _rest_ of the Diagram to a'), the West Half to b, the Horizontal Oblong to c, and the Upright Oblong to d. We have now got 16 Cells. .---------------------. | | | | .---|---. | | | | | | | .---|---|---|---. | | | | | | | | |--|---|---|---|---|--| | | | | | | | | .---|---|---|---. | | | | | | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------------. For _five_ letters (adding e) I subdivide the 16 Cells of the previous Diagram by _oblique_ partitions, assigning all the _upper_ portions to e, and all the _lower_ portions to e'. Here, I admit, we lose the advantage of having the e-Class all _together_, "in a ring-fence", like the other 4 Classes.
