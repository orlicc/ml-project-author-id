Such a Set, with the last Conclusion tacked on, is called a '=Sorites='; the original Set of Propositions is called its '=Premisses='; each of the intermediate Conclusions is called a '=Partial Conclusion=' of the Sorites; the last Conclusion is called its '=Complete Conclusion=,' or, more briefly, its '=Conclusion='; the Genus, of which all the Terms are Species, is called its '=Universe of Discourse=', or, more briefly, its '=Univ.='; the Terms, used as Eliminands in the Syllogisms, are called its '=Eliminands='; and the two Terms, which are retained, and therefore appear in the Conclusion, are called its '=Retinends='. [Note that each _Partial_ Conclusion contains one or two _Eliminands_; but that the _Complete_ Conclusion contains _Retinends_ only.] The Conclusion is said to be '=consequent=' from the Premisses; for which reason it is usual to prefix to it the word "Therefore" (or the symbol ".'."). [Note that the question, whether the Conclusion is or is not _consequent_ from the Premisses, is not affected by the _actual_ truth or falsity of any one of the Propositions which make up the Sorites, by depends entirely on
