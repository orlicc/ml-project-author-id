Similarly we may interpret _two Grey_ Counters, when placed in the South, or West, or East Half. * * * * * Lastly, let us suppose that we find a _Red_ and a _Grey_ Counter placed in the North Half, the _Red_ in the North-_West_ Cell, and the _Grey_ in the North-_East_ Cell. .-------. |(.)|( )| |---|---| | | | .-------. We know that this represents the Proposition, "All x are y". [Note that the _Half_, occupied by the two Counters, settles what is to be the _Subject_ of the Proposition, and that the _Cell_, occupied by the _Red_ Counter, settles what is to be its _Predicate_.] pg038 Similarly we may interpret a _Red_
