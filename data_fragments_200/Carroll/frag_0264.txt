We translate them, if necessary, into subscript-form, and then proceed as follows:-- (1) We examine their Subscripts, in order to see whether they are (a) a Pair of Nullities; or (b) a Nullity and an Entity; or (c) a Pair of Entities. (2) If they are a Pair of Nullities, we examine their Eliminands, in order to see whether they are Unlike or Like. If their Eliminands are _Unlike_, it is a case of Fig. I. We then examine their Retinends, to see whether one or both of them are asserted to _exist_. If one Retinend is so asserted, it is a case of Fig. I
