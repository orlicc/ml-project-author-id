It may, perhaps, occur to the Reader, who has studied Formal Logic that the argument, here applied to the Propositions I and E, will apply equally well to the Propositions I and A (since, in the ordinary text-books, the Propositions "All xy are z" and "Some xy are not z" are regarded as Contradictories). Hence it may appear to him that the argument might have been put as follows:-- "We now have I and A 'asserting.' Hence, if the Proposition 'All xy are z' be true, some things exist with the Attributes x and y: i.e. 'Some x are y.' "Also we know that, if the Proposition 'Some xy are not-z' be true the same result follows. "But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of them _must_ be true. Hence this result is always true: i.e. the Proposition 'Some x are y' is _always_ true! "_Quod est absurdum._ Hence I _cannot_ assert." This matter will be discussed in Part II; but I may as well give here what seems to me to be an irresistable proof that this view (that _A_ and _I_ are Contradictories), though adopted in the ordinary text-books, is untenable. The proof is
