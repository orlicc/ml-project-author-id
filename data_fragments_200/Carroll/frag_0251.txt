it also represents the Proposition "All x are y". [The Reader will perhaps be puzzled by the statement that the Proposition "All x are y" is equivalent to the Double Proposition "Some x exist and no xy' exist," remembering that it was stated, at p. 33, to be equivalent to the Double Proposition "Some x are y and no x are y'" (i.e. "Some xy exist and no xy' exist"). The explanation is that the Proposition "Some xy exist" contains _superfluous information_. "Some x exist" is enough for our purpose.] This expression may be written in a shorter form, viz. "x_{1}y'_{0}", since _each_ Subscript takes effect back to the _beginning_ of the expression. Similarly we may represent the seven similar Propositions "All x are y'", "All x' are y", "All x' are y'", "All y are x", "All y are x'", "All y' are x", and "All y' are x'". [The Reader should make out all these for himself.] It will be convenient to remember that, in translating a Proposition, beginning with "All", from abstract form into subscript form, or _vice versa_, the Predicate _changes sign_ (that is, changes from positive to negative, or else from negative to positive). [Thus,
