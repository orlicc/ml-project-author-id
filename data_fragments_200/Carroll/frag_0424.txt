Thus, the lattice in the N.W. corner serves to accommodate the 16 Classes abc'd'ehkl, abc'd'eh'kl', &c. This Octoliteral Diagram (see next page) contains 256 Cells. For _nine_ letters, I place 2 Octoliteral Diagrams side by side, assigning one of them to m, and the other to m'. We have now got 512 Cells. pg179 #=====================================================================# H | H | H H | #===============H===============# | H H | H | H | H |
