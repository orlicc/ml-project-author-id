let us suppose that we have selected a certain Adjunct, which we may call "x," and have divided the large Class, to which we have assigned the whole Diagram, into the two smaller Classes whose Differentiae are "x" and "not-x" (which we may call "x'"), and that we have assigned the _North_ Half of the Diagram to the one (which we may call "the Class of x-Things," or "the x-Class"), and the _South_ Half to the other (which we may call "the Class of x'-Things," or "the x'-Class"). [For example, we might say "Let x mean 'old,' so that x' will mean 'new'," and we might suppose that we had divided books into the two Classes whose Differentiae are "old" and "new," and had assigned the _North_ Half of the table to "_old_ books" and the _South_ Half to "_new_ books."] Thirdly, let us suppose that we have selected another Adjunct, which we may call "y", and have subdivided the x-Class into the two Classes whose Differentiae are "y" and "y'", and that we have assigned the North-_West_ Cell to the one (which we may call "the xy-Class"), and the North-_East_ Cell to the other (which we may call "the
