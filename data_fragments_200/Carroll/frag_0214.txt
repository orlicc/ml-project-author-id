"No xm' exist", "No x'm exist", &c. * * * * * These sixteen Propositions of Existence are the only ones that we shall have to represent on this Diagram. Sec. 2. _Representation of Propositions of Relation in terms of x and m, or of y and m._ Let us take, first, the Pair of Converse Propositions "Some x are m" = "Some m are x." We know that each of these is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence "Some xm exist", which we already know how to represent. .---------------. | | | | .---|---. | | | (.) | | |---|---|---|---| | | | | | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------. Similarly for the seven similar Pairs, in terms of x and m, or of y and m. Let us take, next, the Pair of Converse Propositions "No x are m" = "No m are x." We know that each of these is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence "No xm exist",
