English books are old".] The two equivalent Propositions, "Some x are y" and "Some y are x", are said to be '=Converse=' to each other; and the Process, of changing one into the other, is called '=Converting=', or '=Conversion='. [For example, if we were told to convert the Proposition "Some apples are not ripe," we should first choose our Univ. (say "fruit"), and then complete the Proposition, by supplying the Substantive "fruit" in the Predicate, so that it would be "Some apples are not-ripe fruit"; and we should then convert it by interchanging its Terms, so that it would be "Some not-ripe fruit are apples".] pg032 Similarly we may represent the three similar Trios of equivalent Propositions; the whole Set of _four_ Trios being as follows:-- (1) "Some xy exist" = "Some x are y" = "Some y are x". (2) "Some xy' exist" = "Some x are y'" = "Some y' are x". (3) "Some x'y exist" = "Some x' are y" = "Some y are x'". (4) "Some x'y' exist" = "Some x' are y'" = "Some y' are x'". Let us take, next, the Proposition "No x are y". This tell us that no Thing, in the
