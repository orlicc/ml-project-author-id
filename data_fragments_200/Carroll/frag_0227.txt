(4) "All m are x; All y are m". Here we break up _both_ Propositions, and thus get _four_ to represent, viz.-- (1) "Some m are x; (2) No m are x'; (3) Some y are m; (4) No y are m'". These we will take in the order 2, 4, 1, 3. First we take No. (2), viz. "No m are x'". This gives us Diagram a. To this we add No. (4), viz. "No y are m'", and thus get Diagram b. If we were to add to this No. (1), viz. "Some m are x", we should have to put the "I" on a fence: so let us try No. (3) instead, viz. "Some y are m". This gives us Diagram c. And now there is no need to trouble about No. (1), as it would
