Hence this is a _Double_ Proposition, and is equivalent to the _two_ Propositions "No old _English_ books exist" and "No old _foreign_ books exist".] Sec. 3. _Representation of Propositions of Relation._ Let us take, first, the Proposition "Some x are y". This tells us that at least _one_ Thing, in the _North_ Half, is also in the _West_ Half. Hence it must be in the space _common_ to them, that is, in the _North-West Cell_. Hence the North-West Cell is _occupied_. And this we can represent by placing a _Red_ Counter in it. .-------. |(.)| | |---|---| | | | .-------. [Note that the _Subject_ of the Proposition settles which _Half_ we are to use; and that the _Predicate_ settles in which _portion_ of it we are to place the Red Counter. In the "books" example, this Proposition would be "Some old books are English".] Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions "Some x are y'", "Some x' are y", and "Some x' are y'". [The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the "books" example, these three Propositions would be "Some old
