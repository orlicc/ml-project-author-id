by which we can at once find, without having to use Diagrams again, the Conclusion to any _other_ Pair of Premisses having the _same_ subscript forms. [Thus, the expression xm_{0} + ym'_{0} > xy_{0} is a Formula, by which we can find the Conclusion to any Pair of Premisses whose subscript forms are xm_{0} + ym'_{0} For example, suppose we had the Pair of Propositions "No gluttons are healthy; No unhealthy men are strong". proposed as Premisses. Taking "men" as our 'Universe', and making m = healthy; x = gluttons; y = strong; we might translate the Pair into abstract form, thus:-- "No x are m; No m' are y". These, in subscript form, would be xm_{0} + m'y_{0} which are identical with those in our _Formula_. Hence we at once know the Conclusion to be xy_{0} that is, in abstract form, "No x are y"; that is, in concrete form, "No gluttons are strong".] I shall now take three different forms of Pairs of Premisses, and work out their Conclusions, once for all, by Diagrams; and thus obtain some useful Formulae. I shall call them "Fig. I", "Fig. II", and "Fig. III". pg075 Fig. I. This includes any Pair
