Note that _all_ Euler's Diagrams assert "Some not-x are not-y." Apparently it never occured to him that it might _sometimes_ fail to be true! Now, to represent "All x are y", the _first_ of these Diagrams would suffice. Similarly, to represent "No x are y", the _third_ would suffice. But to represent any _Particular_ Proposition, at least _three_ Diagrams would be needed (in order to include all
