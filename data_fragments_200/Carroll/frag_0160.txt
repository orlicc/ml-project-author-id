[Thus, the Class "bound books" is codivisional with each of the two Classes, "bound books" and "unbound books." Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been "contemporary" with every event that happened in 1815.] Hence a Class, obtained by Division, is codivisional with itself. [Thus, the Class "bound books" is codivisional with itself. Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been "contemporary" with itself.] pg003 1/2 Sec. 2. _Dichotomy._ If we think of a certain Class, and imagine that we have picked out from it a certain smaller Class, it is evident that the _Remainder_ of the large Class does _not_ possess the Differentia of that
