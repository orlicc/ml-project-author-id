Then, representing "No y' are m" on the same Diagram, we get Diagram b. pg051 a b .---------------. .---------------. |(O) | (O)| |(O) | (O)| | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | | | | | | | |(O)| | |---|---|---|---| |---|---|---|---| | | | | | | | |(O)| | | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | | | | | | .---------------. .---------------. (2) "Some m are x; No m are y". If, neglecting the Rule, we were begin with "Some m are x", we should get Diagram a. And if we were then to take "No m are y", which tells us that the Inner N.W. Cell is _empty_, we should be obliged to take the "I" off the fence (as it no longer has the choice of _two_ Cells), and to put it into the Inner N.E. Cell, as in Diagram c. This trouble may be saved by beginning with "No m are y", as in Diagram b. And _now_, when we take "Some m are x", there is no fence to sit on! The "I" has to go, at once, into the N.E. Cell, as in Diagram c. a b c .---------------. .---------------. .---------------. |
