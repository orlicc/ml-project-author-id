and keep his finger on that particular _part_ of it, about which he is reading.] pg040 Secondly, let us suppose that we have selected a certain Adjunct, which we may call "m", and have subdivided the xy-Class into the two Classes whose Differentiae are m and m', and that we have assigned the N.W. _Inner_ Cell to the one (which we may call "the Class of xym-Things", or "the xym-Class"), and the N.W. _Outer_ Cell to the other (which we may call "the Class of xym'-Things", or "the xym'-Class"). [Thus, in the "books" example, we might say "Let m mean 'bound', so that m' will mean 'unbound'", and we might suppose that we had subdivided the Class "old English books" into the two Classes, "old English bound books" and "old English unbound books", and had assigned the N.W. _Inner_ Cell to the one, and the N.W. _Outer_ Cell to the other.] Thirdly, let us suppose that we have subdivided the xy'-Class, the x'y-Class, and the x'y'-Class in the same manner, and have, in each case, assigned the _Inner_ Cell to the Class possessing the Attribute m, and the _Outer_ Cell to the Class possessing the Attribute m'. [Thus, in the
