e'"; but, if the Premisses were arranged in other ways, other Partial Conclusions might be obtained. Thus, the order 41523 yields the Partial Conclusions "No c' are b'", "All h are b", "All h are c". There are altogether _nine_ Partial Conclusions to this Sorites, which the Reader will find it an interesting task to make out for himself.] pg087 CHAPTER II. _PROBLEMS IN SORITESES._ Sec. 1. _Introductory._ The Problems we shall have to solve are of the following form:-- "Given three or more Propositions of Relation, which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them." We will limit ourselves, at present, to Problems which can be worked by the Formulae of Fig. I. (See p. 75.) Those, that require _other_ Formulae, are rather too hard for beginners. Such Problems may be solved by either of two Methods, viz. (1) The Method of Separate Syllogisms; (2) The Method of Underscoring. These shall be discussed separately. pg088 Sec. 2. _Solution by Method of Separate Syllogisms._ The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:-- (1) Name the 'Universe of Discourse'. (2) Construct a Dictionary, making a, b, c, &c. represent the Terms. (3) Put the Proposed
