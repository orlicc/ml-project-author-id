their _relationship to one another_. pg086 As a specimen-Sorites, let us take the following Set of 5 Propositions:-- (1) "No a are b'; (2) All b are c; (3) All c are d; (4) No e' are a'; (5) All h are e'". Here the first and second, taken together, yield "No a are c'". This, taken along with the third, yields "No a are d'". This, taken along with the fourth, yields "No d' are e'". And this, taken along with the fifth, yields "All h are d". Hence, if the original Set were true, this would _also_ be true. Hence the original Set, with this tacked on, is a _Sorites_; the original Set is its _Premisses_; the Proposition "All h are d" is its _Conclusion_; the Terms a, b, c, e are its _Eliminands_; and the Terms d and h are its _Retinends_. Hence we may write the whole Sorites thus:-- "No a are b'; All b are c; All c are d; No e' are a'; All h are e'. .'. All h are d". In the above Sorites, the 3 Partial Conclusions are the Positions "No a are e'", "No a are d'", "No d' are
