DIAGRAM._ The Reader had better now begin to draw little Diagrams for himself, and to mark them with the Digits "I" and "O", instead of using the Board and Counters: he may put a "I" to represent a _Red_ Counter (this may be interpreted to mean "There is at least _one_ Thing here"), and a "O" to represent a _Grey_ Counter (this may be interpreted to mean "There is _nothing_ here"). The Pair of Propositions, that we shall have to represent, will always be, one in terms of x and m, and the other in terms of y and m. When we have to represent a Proposition beginning with "All", we break it up into the _two_ Propositions to which it is equivalent. When we have to represent, on the same Diagram, Propositions, of which some begin with "Some" and others with "No", we represent the _negative_ ones _first_. This will sometimes save us from having to put a "I" "on a fence" and afterwards having to shift it into a Cell. [Let us work a few examples. (1) "No x are m'; No y' are m". Let us first represent "No x are m'". This gives us Diagram a.
