"Some x are y'" = "Some y' are x", "Some x' are y" = "Some y are x'", "Some x' are y'" = "Some y' are x'". Let us take, next, the Proposition "No x are y". This, we know, is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence "No xy exist". (See p. 33.) Hence it may be represented by the expression "xy_{0}". The Converse Proposition "No y are x" may of course be represented by the _same_ expression, viz. "xy_{0}". Similarly we may represent the three similar Pairs of Converse Propositions, viz.-- "No x are y'" = "No y' are x", "No x' are y" = "No y are x'", "No x' are y'" = "No y' are x'". pg072 Let us take, next, the Proposition "All x are y". Now it is evident that the Double Proposition of Existence "Some x exist and no xy' exist" tells us that _some_ x-Things exist, but that _none_ of them have the Attribute y': that is, it tells us that _all_ of them have the Attribute y: that is, it tells us that "All x are y". Also it is evident that the expression "x_{1} + xy'_{0}" represents this Double Proposition. Hence
