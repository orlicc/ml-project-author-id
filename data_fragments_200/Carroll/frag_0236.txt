Then the Proposition may be written "Some military men are brave men"; _i.e._ "Some x-men are y-men"; _i.e._ (omitting "men," as explained at p. 26) "Some x are y." In practice, we should merely say "Let Univ. be "men", x = soldiers, y = brave", and at once translate "Some soldiers are brave" into "Some x are y."] The Problems we shall have to solve are of two kinds, viz. (1) "Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them." (2) "Given a Trio of Propositions of Relation, of which every two contain a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as a Syllogism: to ascertain whether the proposed Conclusion is consequent from the proposed Premisses, and, if so, whether it is _complete_." These Problems we will discuss separately. pg060 Sec. 2. _Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them._ The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:-- (1) Determine the 'Universe
