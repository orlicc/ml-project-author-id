a Triliteral Diagram, we break up the first into the two Propositions to which it is equivalent, and thus get the _three_ Propositions (1) "Some m are x; (2) No m are x'; (3) Some y are m". The Rule, given at p. 50, would make us take these in the order 2, 1, 3. This, however, would produce the result .-----------------. | | | | .----|----. | | |(I)(I) | | | |----|----| | | |(O) | (O)| | | .----|----. | | | | .-----------------. pg062 So it would be better to take them in the order 2, 3, 1. Nos. (2) and (3) give us the result here shown; and now we need not trouble about No. (1), as the Proposition "Some m are x" is _already_ represented on the Diagram. .---------------. | | | | .---|---. | | |(I)| | | |---|---|---|---| | |(O)|(O)| | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------. Transferring our information to a Biliteral Diagram, we get .-------. |(I)| | |---|---| | | | .-------. This result we can read either as "Some x are y" or "Some y are x". After consulting our Dictionary, we choose "Some y are x", which,
