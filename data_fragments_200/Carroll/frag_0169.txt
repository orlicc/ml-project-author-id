"Some", is said to be '=Particular=.' It is also called 'a Proposition =in I=.' [Note, that it is called 'Particular,' because it refers to a _part_ only of the Subject.] A Proposition, that begins with "No", is said to be '=Universal Negative=.' It is also called 'a Proposition =in E=.' A Proposition, that begins with "All", is said to be '=Universal Affirmative=.' It is also called 'a Proposition =in A=.' [Note, that they are called 'Universal', because they refer to the _whole_ of the Subject.] A Proposition, whose Subject is an _Individual_, is to be regarded as _Universal_. [Let us take, as an example, the Proposition "John is not well". This of course implies that there is an _Individual_, to whom the speaker refers when he mentions "John", and whom the listener _knows_ to be referred to. Hence the Class "men referred to by the speaker when he mentions 'John'" is a one-Member Class, and the Proposition is equivalent to "_All_ the men, who are referred to by the speaker when he mentions 'John', are not well."] Propositions are of two kinds, 'Propositions of Existence' and 'Propositions of Relation.' These shall be discussed separately. pg011 CHAPTER II. _PROPOSITIONS OF EXISTENCE._
