On examination we find that Figs. 5, 10, 13 express the relation of entire mutual exclusion; that Figs. 6, 11 express partial inclusion and partial exclusion; that Fig. 7 expresses coincidence; that Figs. 8, 12 express entire inclusion of x in y; and that Fig. 9 expresses entire inclusion of y in x. pg182 We thus get five Biliteral Diagrams for x and y, viz. 14 _____ _____ _/ \_ _/ \_ / \ / \ | x | | y | \_ _/ \_ _/ \_____/ \_____/ 15 _____ _____ _/ \_/ \_ / / \ \ | x | | y | \_ \_/ _/ \_____/ \_____/ 16 _____ _/ \_ / \ | xy
