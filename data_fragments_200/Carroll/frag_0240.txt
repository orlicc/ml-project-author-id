translated into concrete form, is "Some chickens understand French." (3) "All diligent students are successful; All ignorant students are unsuccessful". Let Univ. be "students"; m = successful; x = diligent; y = ignorant. These Premisses, in abstract form, are "All x are m; All y are m'". These, broken up, give us the four Propositions (1) "Some x are m; (2) No x are m'; (3) Some y are m'; (4) No y are m". which we will take in the order 2, 4, 1, 3. Representing these on a Triliteral Diagram, we get .---------------. |(O) | (O)| | .---|---. | | |(O)|(I)| | |---|---|---|---| | |(O)| | | | .---|---. | |(I) | | .---------------. And this information, transferred to a Biliteral Diagram, is .-------. |(O)|(I)| |---|---| |(I)| | .-------. Here we get _two_ Conclusions, viz. "All x are y'; All y are x'." pg063 And these, translated into concrete form, are "All diligent students are (not-ignorant, i.e.) learned; All ignorant students are (not-diligent, i.e.) idle". (See p. 4.) (4) "Of the prisoners who were put on their trial at the last Assizes, all, against whom the verdict 'guilty' was returned, were sentenced to imprisonment; Some, who were sentenced
