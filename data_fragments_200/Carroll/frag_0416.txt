ever attempted to represent "No x' are y'." Mr. Venn _once_ (at p. 281) encounters this awful task; but evades it, in a quite masterly fashion, by the simple foot-note "We have not troubled to shade the outside of this diagram"! To represent _two_ Propositions (containing a common Term) _together_, a _three_-letter Diagram is needed. This is the one used by Mr. Venn. _____ _/ \_ _/___ x ___\_ _/| \_/ |\_ / \_ / \ _/ \ | \|___|/ | \_ m \_/ y _/ \_____/ \_____/ Here, again, we have only _seven_ closed Compartments, to accommodate the _eight_ Classes whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are xym, xym', &c. "With four terms in request," Mr. Venn says, "the most simple and symmetrical diagram seems to me that produced by making four ellipses intersect one another in the desired manner". This, however, provides only _fifteen_ closed compartments. b ____ ____ c / \ / \ a ___/___ \/ ___\___ d / \ \ /\ / / \ / \ \/ \/ / \ \ \ /\ /\ / / \ \/ \/ \/ / \ /\ /\ /\ / \ \ \/ \/ / / \ \/\ /\/ / \
