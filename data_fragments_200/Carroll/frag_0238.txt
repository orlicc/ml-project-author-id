into abstract form, as follows:-- "No x are m'; All m are y". pg061 Next, by the process described at p. 50, we represent these on a Triliteral Diagram, thus:-- .---------------. |(O) | (O)| | .---|---. | | | |(O)| | |---|(I)|---|---| | | |(O)| | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------. Next, by the process described at p. 53, we transfer to a Biliteral Diagram all the information we can. .-------. | |(O)| |---|---| | | | .-------. The result we read as "No x are y'" or as "No y' are x," whichever we prefer. So we refer to our Dictionary, to see which will look best; and we choose "No x are y'", which, translated into concrete form, is "No son of mine fails to be treated with respect". (2) "All cats understand French; Some chickens are cats". Taking "creatures" as Univ., we write these as follows:-- "All cats are creatures understanding French; Some chickens are cats".

In order to represent these on
