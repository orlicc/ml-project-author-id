which both the Subject and the Predicate are Specieses) has been divided (by the Process of _Dichotomy_) into two smaller Classes, viz. (1) the Predicate; (2) the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of the Predicate. [Thus, we may suppose that the Genus "men," (of which both "bankers" and "rich men" are Specieses) has been divided into the two smaller Classes, "rich men", "poor men".] pg018 Now we know that _every_ Member of the Subject is (as shown at p. 6) a Member of the Univ. Hence _every_ Member of the Subject is either in Class (1) or else in Class (2). [Thus, we know that _every_ banker is a Member of the Genus "men". Hence, _every_ banker is either in the Class "rich men", or else in the Class "poor men".] Also we have been told that, in the case we are discussing, _some_ Members of the Subject are in Class (1). What _else_ do we need to be told, in order to know that _all_ of them are there? Evidently we need to be told that _none_ of them are in Class (2); i.e. that _none_ of them are Members of the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_
