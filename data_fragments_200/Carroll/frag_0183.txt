beginning with "Some" and the other with "No", each of which we now know how to translate. [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules. (1) "Some apples are not ripe." Here we arrange thus:-- "Some" _Sign of Quantity_. "existing Things" _Subject_. "are" _Copula_. "not-ripe apples" _Predicate_. or thus:-- "Some | existing Things | are | not-ripe apples." pg021 (2) "Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be." Here we arrange thus:-- "Some | existing Things | are | farmers who always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be." (3) "No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars." Here we arrange thus:-- "No | existing Things |are | lambs accustomed to smoke cigars." (4) "None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent." Here we arrange thus:-- "No | existing Things | are | speculations of mine, which have brought me as much as 5 per cent." (5) "None but the brave deserve the fair." Here we note, to begin with, that the phrase "none but the brave" is equivalent to "no not-brave men." We then arrange thus:-- "No | existing Things | are | not-brave men deserving of the fair."
