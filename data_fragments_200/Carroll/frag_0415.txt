the possible cases), and, for "Some not-x are not-y", all the _four_. Sec. 6. _Venn's Method of Diagrams._ Let us represent "not-x" by "x'". Mr. Venn's Method of Diagrams is a great advance on the above Method. He uses the last of the above Diagrams to represent _any_ desired relation between x and y, by simply shading a Compartment known to be _empty_, and placing a + in one known to be _occupied_. Thus, he would represent the three Propositions "Some x are y", "No x are y", and "All x are y", as follows:-- _____ _____ _/ \_/ \_ / / \ \ | | + | | \_ \_/ _/ \_____/ \_____/ _____ _____ _/ \_/ \_ / /#\ \ | |###| | \_ \#/ _/ \_____/ \_____/ _____ _____ _/#####\_/ \_ /#######/ \ \ |#######| + | | \#######\_/ _/ \#####/ \_____/ pg175 It will be seen that, of the _four_ Classes, whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are xy, xy', x'y, and x'y', only _three_ are here provided with closed Compartments, while the _fourth_ is allowed the rest of the Infinite Plane to range about in! This arrangement would involve us in very serious trouble, if we
