But what we have to represent is, that both Cells are _certainly_ empty: and this can only be done by placing a _Grey_ Counter in _each_ of them. In the "books" example, this Proposition would be "No old books exist".] pg029 Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions "No x' exist", "No y exist", and "No y' exist". [The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the "books" example, these three Propositions would be "No new books exist", &c.] Let us take, next, the Proposition "Some xy exist". This tells us that there is at least _one_ Thing in the North-West Cell; that is, that the North-West Cell is _occupied_. And this we can represent by placing a _Red_ Counter in it. .-------. |(.)| | |---|---| | | | .-------.
