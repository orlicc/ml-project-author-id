merely tells us that the Inner Portion of the W. Half is _occupied_, so that we may place a 'I' in it, _somewhere_; but, if this were the _whole_ of our information, we should not know in _which_ Cell to place it, so that it would have to 'sit on the fence': it is only when we learn, from the other Premiss, that the _upper_ of these two Cells is _empty_, that we feel authorised to place the 'I' in the _lower_ Cell, and thus to prove the Conclusion x'y_{1}. Lastly, in Fig. III., the information, that m _exists_, merely authorises us to place a 'I' _somewhere_ in the Inner Square----but it has large choice of fences to sit upon! It needs the Premiss xm_{0} to drive it out of the N. Half of that Square; and it needs the Premiss ym_{0} to drive it out of the W. Half. Hence it needs the _two_ Premisses to drive it into the Inner Portion of the S.E. Quarter, and thus to prove the Conclusion x'y'_{1}. pg165 APPENDIX, ADDRESSED TO TEACHERS.
