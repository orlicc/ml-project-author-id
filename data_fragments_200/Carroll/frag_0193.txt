the "books" example, these three Propositions would be "Some old foreign books exist", &c.] Let us take, next, the Proposition "No xy exist". This tells us that there is _nothing_ in the North-West Cell; that is, that the North-West Cell is _empty_. And this we can represent by placing a _Grey_ Counter in it. .-------. |( )| | |---|---| | | | .-------. [In the "books" example, this Proposition would be "No old English books exist".] Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions "No xy' exist", "No x'y exist", and "No x'y' exist". [The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the "books" example, these three Propositions would be "No old foreign books exist", &c.] pg030 We have seen that the Proposition "No x exist" may be represented by placing _two Grey_ Counters in the North Half, one in each Cell. .-------. |( )|( )| |---|---| | | | .-------. We have also seen that these two _Grey_ Counters, taken _separately_, represent the two Propositions "No xy exist" and "No xy' exist". Hence we see that the Proposition "No x exist" is a _Double_ Proposition, and is equivalent to the _two_ Propositions "No xy exist" and "No
