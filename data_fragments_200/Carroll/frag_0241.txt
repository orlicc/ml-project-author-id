Representing these, in the order 2, 1, 3, on a Triliteral Diagram, we get .---------------. |(O) | (O)| | .---|---. | | | (I) | | |---|(I)|---|---| | | | | | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------. Here we get no Conclusion at all. You would very likely have guessed, if you had seen _only_ the Premisses, that the Conclusion would be "Some, against whom the verdict 'guilty' was returned, were sentenced to hard labour". But this Conclusion is not even _true_, with regard to the Assizes I have here invented. "Not _true!_" you exclaim.
