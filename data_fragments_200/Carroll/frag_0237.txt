of Discourse'. (2) Construct a Dictionary, making m and m (or m and m') represent the pair of codivisional Classes, and x (or x') and y (or y') the other two. (3) Translate the proposed Premisses into abstract form. (4) Represent them, together, on a Triliteral Diagram. (5) Ascertain what Proposition, if any, in terms of x and y, is _also_ represented on it. (6) Translate this into concrete form. It is evident that, if the proposed Premisses were true, this other Proposition would _also_ be true. Hence it is a _Conclusion_ consequent from the proposed Premisses. [Let us work some examples. (1) "No son of mine is dishonest; People always treat an honest man with respect". Taking "men" as Univ., we may write these as follows:-- "No sons of mine are dishonest men; All honest men are men treated with respect". We can now construct our Dictionary, viz. m = honest; x = sons of mine; y = treated with respect. (Note that the expression "x = sons of mine" is an abbreviated form of "x = the Differentia of 'sons of mine', when regarded as a Species of 'men'".) The next thing is to translate the proposed Premisses
