mustard, then either Dix takes neither condiment, or Mill takes both. (2) If Cole takes salt, then either Barry takes only _one_ condiment, or Mill takes neither: if he takes mustard, then either Dix or Lang takes both. (3) If Dix takes salt, then either Barry takes neither condiment or Cole take both: if he takes mustard, then either Lang or Mill takes neither. (4) If Lang takes salt, then Barry or Dix takes only _one_ condiment: if he takes mustard, then either Cole or Mill takes neither. (5) If Mill takes salt, then either Barry or Lang takes both condiments: if he takes mustard, then either Cole or Dix takes only _one_. The Problem is to discover whether these rules are _compatible_; and, if so, what arrangements are possible. [N.B. In this Problem, it is assumed that the phrase "if Barry takes salt" allows of _two_ possible cases, viz. (1) "he takes salt _only_"; (2) "he takes _both_ condiments". And so with all similar phrases. It is also assumed that the phrase "either Cole or Lang takes _one_ only of the two condiments" allows _three_ possible cases, viz. (1) "Cole takes _one_ only, Lang takes both or neither"; (2)
