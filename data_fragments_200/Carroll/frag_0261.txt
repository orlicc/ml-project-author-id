in _I_, or _E_, or _A_, (the only kinds with which we are now concerned,) the Fallacy may be detected by the 'Method of Diagrams,' by simply setting them out on a Triliteral Diagram, and observing that they yield no information which can be transferred to the Biliteral Diagram. But suppose we were working by the 'Method of _Subscripts_,' and had to deal with a Pair of proposed Premisses, which happened to be a 'Fallacy,' how could we be certain that they would not yield any Conclusion? Our best plan is, I think, to deal with _Fallacies_ in the same was as we have already dealt with _Syllogisms_: that is, to take certain forms of Pairs of Propositions, and to work them out, once for all, on the Triliteral Diagram, and ascertain that they yield _no_ Conclusion; and then to record them, for future use, as _Formulae for Fallacies_, just as we have already recorded our three _Formulae for Syllogisms_. pg082 Now, if we were to record the two Sets of Formulae in the _same_ shape, viz. by the Method of Subscripts, there would be considerable risk of confusing the two kinds. Hence, in order to keep them distinct, I
