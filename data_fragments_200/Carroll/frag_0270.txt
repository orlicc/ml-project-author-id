on this beat; l = supping with our cook pg089 We now have to put the proposed Premisses into _subscript_ form. Let us begin by putting them into _abstract_ form. The result is (1) "All k are l; (2) No d are h'; (3) All a are c'; (4) All b are e; (5) No k' are h; (6) No b' are l; (7) All d' are c." And it is now easy to put them into _subscript_ form, as follows:-- (1) k_{1}l'_{0} (2) dh'_{0} (3) a_{1}c_{0} (4) b_{1}e'_{0} (5) k'h_{0} (6) b'l_{0} (7) d'_{1}c'_{0} We now have to find a pair of Premisses which will yield a Conclusion. Let us begin with No. (1), and look down the list, till we come to one which we can take along with it, so as to form Premisses belonging to Fig. I. We find that No. (5) will do, since we can take k as our Eliminand. So our first syllogism is (1) k_{1}l'_{0} (5) k'h_{0} .'. l'h_{0} ... (8) We must now begin again with l'h_{0} and find a Premiss to go along with it. We find that No. (2) will do, h being our Eliminand. So our next Syllogism
