x_{1}y_{0}) x'_{1}m_{0} + y_{1}m'_{0} (which proves x'_{1}y_{0} + y_{1}x'_{0}).] The Formula, to be remembered, is xm_{0} + ym'_{0} > xy_{0} with the following two Rules:-- (1) _Two Nullities, with Unlike Eliminands, yield a Nullity, in which both Retinends keep their Signs._ pg076 (2) _A Retinend, asserted in the Premisses to exist, may be so asserted in the Conclusion._ [Note that Rule (1) is merely the Formula expressed in words.] Fig. II. This includes any Pair of Premisses, of which one is a Nullity and the other an Entity, and which contain Like Eliminands. The simplest case is xm_{0} + ym_{1} .---------------. .-------. | | | | | | | .---|---. | |---|---| | |(O)|(O)| | |(I)| | |---|---|---|---| .-------. | |(I)| | | | .---|---. | .'. x'y_{1} | | | .---------------. In this case we see that the Conclusion is an Entity, and that the Nullity-Retinend has changed its Sign. And we should find this Rule to hold good with _any_ Pair of Premisses which fulfil the given conditions. [The Reader had better satisfy himself of this, by working out, on Diagrams, several varieties, such as x'm_{0} + ym_{1} (which > xy_{1}) x_{1}m'_{0} + y'm'_{1} (which > x'y'_{1}) m_{1}x_{0}
