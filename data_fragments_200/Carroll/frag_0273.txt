_Complete_ Conclusion; and for _them_ it will be easy enough to refer to the original list. pg092 [I will now go through the process of solving, by this method, the example worked in Sec. 2. The Data are 1 2 3 4 k_{1}l'_{0} + dh'_{0} + a_{1}c_{0} + b_{1}e'_{0} + 5 6 7 k'h_{0} + b'l_{0} + d'_{1}c'_{0} The Reader should take a piece of paper, and write out this solution for himself. The first line will consist of the above Data; the second must be composed, bit by bit, according to the following directions. We begin by writing down the first Premiss, with its numeral over it, but omitting the subscripts. We have now to find a Premiss which can be combined with this, _i.e._, a Premiss containing either k' or l. The first we find is No. 5; and this we tack on, with a +. To get the _Conclusion_ from these, k and k' must be eliminated, and what remains must be taken as one expression. So we _underscore_ them, putting a _single_ score under k, and a _double_ one under k'. The result we read as l'h. We must now find a Premiss containing either l
