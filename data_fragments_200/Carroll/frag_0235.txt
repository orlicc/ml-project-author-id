at any time when provisions ran short, to utilise the nursery-governess for the nursery-dinner!) Hence the Trio is a _Syllogism_; the Genus "creatures" is its 'Univ.'; the two Propositions, "All cats understand French" and "Some chickens are cats", are its _Premisses_, the Proposition "Some chickens understand French" is its _Conclusion_; the Terms "cats" and "cats" are its _Eliminands_; and the Terms, "creatures understanding French" and "chickens", are its _Retinends_. Hence we may write it thus:-- "All cats understand French; Some chickens are cats; .'. Some chickens understand French".] pg059 CHAPTER II. _PROBLEMS IN SYLLOGISMS._ Sec. 1. _Introductory._ When the Terms of a Proposition are represented by _words_, it is said to be '=concrete='; when by _letters_, '=abstract=.' To translate a Proposition from concrete into abstract form, we fix on a Univ., and regard each Term as a _Species_ of it, and we choose a letter to represent its _Differentia_. [For example, suppose we wish to translate "Some soldiers are brave" into abstract form. We may take "men" as Univ., and regard "soldiers" and "brave men" as _Species_ of the _Genus_ "men"; and we may choose x to represent the peculiar Attribute (say "military") of "soldiers," and y to represent "brave."
