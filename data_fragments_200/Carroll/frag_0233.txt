appear in the Conclusion. Note also that the question, whether the Conclusion is or is not _consequent_ from the Premisses, is not affected by the _actual_ truth or falsity of any of the Trio, but depends entirely on their _relationship to each other_. As a specimen-Syllogism, let us take the Trio "No x-Things are m-Things; No y-Things are m'-Things. No x-Things are y-Things." which we may write, as explained at p. 26, thus:-- "No x are m; No y are m'. No x are y". Here the first and second contain the Pair of codivisional Classes m and m'; the first and third contain the Pair x and x; and the second and third contain the Pair y and y. Also the three Propositions are (as we shall see hereafter) so related that, if the first two were true, the third would also be true. Hence the Trio is a _Syllogism_; the two Propositions, "No x are m" and "No y are m'", are its _Premisses_; the Proposition "No x are y" is its _Conclusion_; the Terms m and m' are its _Eliminands_; and the Terms x and y are its _Retinends_. Hence we may write it thus:-- "No x
