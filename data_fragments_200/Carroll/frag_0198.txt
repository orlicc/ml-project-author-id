In the "books" example, these three Propositions would be "No English books are new", &c.] pg033 .-------. |( )| | |---|---| | | | .-------. We see that this _one_ Diagram has now served to present no less than _three_ Propositions, viz. (1) "No xy exist; (2) No x are y; (3) No y are x." Hence these three Propositions are equivalent. [In the "books" example, these Propositions would be (1) "No old English books exist; (2) No old books are English; (3) No English books are old".] The two equivalent Propositions, "No x are y" and "No y are x", are said to be 'Converse' to each other. [For example, if we were told to convert the Proposition "No porcupines are talkative", we should first choose our Univ. (say "animals"), and then complete the Proposition, by supplying the Substantive "animals" in the Predicate, so that it would be "No porcupines are talkative animals", and we should then convert it, by interchanging its Terms, so that it would be "No talkative animals are porcupines".] Similarly we may
