A '=Proposition of Existence=', when in normal form, has, for its _Subject_, the Class "existing Things". Its Sign of Quantity is "Some" or "No". [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_ existing Things are Members of its Predicate, it does _not_ tell us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with _two_ numbers, which are, in ascending order, "0" and "1 or more."] It is called "a Proposition of Existence" because its effect is to assert the _Reality_ (i.e. the real _existence_), or else the _Imaginariness_, of its Predicate. [Thus, the Proposition "Some existing Things are honest men" asserts that the Class "honest men" is _Real_. This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms:-- (1) "Honest men exist"; (2) "Some honest men exist"; (3) "The Class 'honest men' exists"; (4) "There are honest men"; (5) "There are some honest men". Similarly, the Proposition "No existing Things are men fifty feet high" asserts that the Class "men 50 feet high" is _Imaginary_. This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms:-- (1) "Men 50 feet high do
