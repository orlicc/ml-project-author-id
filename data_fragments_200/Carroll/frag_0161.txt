smaller Class. Hence it may be regarded as _another_ smaller Class, whose Differentia may be formed, from that of the Class first picked out, by prefixing the word "not"; and we may imagine that we have _divided_ the Class first thought of into _two_ smaller Classes, whose Differentiae are _contradictory_. This kind of Division is called '=Dichotomy='. [For example, we may divide "books" into the two Classes whose Differentiae are "old" and "not-old."] In performing this Process, we may sometimes find that the Attributes we have chosen are used so loosely, in ordinary conversation, that it is not easy to decide _which_ of the Things belong to the one Class and _which_ to the other. In such a case, it would be necessary to lay down some arbitrary _rule_, as to _where_ the one Class should end and the other begin. [Thus, in dividing "books" into "old" and "not-old," we may say "Let all books printed before A.D. 1801, be regarded as 'old,' and all others as 'not-old'."] Henceforwards let it be understood that, if a Class of Things be divided into two Classes, whose Differentiae have contrary meanings, each Differentia is to be regarded as equivalent to the other
