the Proposition "All y are x'" becomes "y_{1}x_{0}", where the Predicate changes from x' to x. Again, the expression "x'_{1}y'_{0}" becomes "All x' are y", where the Predicate changes for y' to y.] pg073 CHAPTER III. _SYLLOGISMS._ Sec. 1. _Representation of Syllogisms._ We already know how to represent each of the three Propositions of a Syllogism in subscript form. When that is done, all we need, besides, is to write the three expressions in a row, with "+" between the Premisses, and ">" before the Conclusion. [Thus the Syllogism "No x are m'; All m are y. .'. No x are y'." may be represented thus:-- xm'_{0} + m_{1}y'_{0} > xy'_{0} When a Proposition has to be translated from concrete form into subscript form, the Reader will find it convenient, just at first, to translate it into _abstract_ form, and _thence_ into subscript form. But, after a little practice, he will find it quite easy to go straight from concrete form to subscript form.] pg074 Sec. 2. _Formulae for solving Problems in Syllogisms._ When once we have found, by Diagrams, the Conclusion to a given Pair of Premisses, and have represented the Syllogism in subscript form, we have a _Formula_,
