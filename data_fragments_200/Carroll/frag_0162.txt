with the word "not" prefixed. [Thus, if "books" be divided into "old" and "new" the Attribute "old" is to be regarded as equivalent to "not-new," and the Attribute "new" as equivalent to "not-old."] pg004 After dividing a Class, by the Process of _Dichotomy_, into two smaller Classes, we may sub-divide each of these into two still smaller Classes; and this Process may be repeated over and over again, the number of Classes being doubled at each repetition. [For example, we may divide "books" into "old" and "new" (i.e. "_not_-old"): we may then sub-divide each of these into "English" and "foreign" (i.e. "_not_-English"), thus getting _four_ Classes, viz. (1) old English; (2) old foreign; (3) new English; (4) new foreign. If we had begun by dividing into "English" and "foreign," and had then sub-divided into "old" and "new," the four Classes would have been (1) English old; (2) English new; (3) foreign old; (4) foreign new. The Reader will easily see that these are the very same four Classes which we had before.] pg004 1/2 CHAPTER IV. _NAMES._ The word "Thing", which conveys the idea of a Thing, _without_ any idea of an Adjunct, represents _any_ single Thing.
