propose to record the Formulae for _Fallacies_ in _words_, and to call them "Forms" instead of "Formulae." Let us now proceed to find, by the Method of Diagrams, three "Forms of Fallacies," which we will then put on record for future use. They are as follows:-- (1) Fallacy of Like Eliminands not asserted to exist. (2) Fallacy of Unlike Eliminands with an Entity-Premiss. (3) Fallacy of two Entity-Premisses. These shall be discussed separately, and it will be seen that each fails to yield a Conclusion. (1) _Fallacy of Like Eliminands not asserted to exist._ It is evident that neither of the given Propositions can be an _Entity_, since that kind asserts the _existence_ of both of its Terms (see p. 20). Hence they must both be _Nullities_. Hence the given Pair may be represented by (xm_{0} + ym_{0}), with or without x_{1}, y_{1}. These, set out on Triliteral Diagrams, are xm_{0} + ym_{0} x_{1}m_{0} + ym_{0} .---------------. .---------------. | | | | (I) | | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | |(O)|(O)| | | |(O)|(O)| | |---|---|---|---| |---|---|---|---| | |(O)| | | | |(O)| | | | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | | | | | | .---------------. .---------------.
