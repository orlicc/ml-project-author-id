a _closed_ area to the _Universe of Discourse_, so that the Class which, under Mr. Venn's liberal sway, has been ranging at will through Infinite Space, is suddenly dismayed to find itself "cabin'd, cribb'd, confined", in a limited Cell like any other Class! Also I use _rectilinear_, instead of _curvilinear_, Figures; and I mark an _occupied_ Cell with a 'I' (meaning that there is at least _one_ Thing in it), and an _empty_ Cell with a 'O' (meaning that there is _no_ Thing in it). For _two_ letters, I use this Diagram, in which the North Half is assigned to 'x', the South to 'not-x' (or 'x''), the West to y, and the East to y'. Thus the N.W. Cell contains the xy-Class, the N.E. Cell the xy'-Class, and so on. .-------. | | | |---|---| | | | .-------. For _three_ letters, I subdivide these four Cells, by drawing an _Inner_ Square, which I assign to m, the _Outer_ Border being assigned to m'. I thus get _eight_ Cells that are needed to accommodate the eight Classes, whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are xym, xym', &c. .---------------. | | | | .---|---. | | | | | | |---|---|---|---|
