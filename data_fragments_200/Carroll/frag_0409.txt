Now the Converse of this Proposition is, of course, "Some boys, who will receive prizes, are in the First Class", which means (according to "The Logicians") "If there _were_ any boys about to receive prizes, some of them _would_ be in the First Class" (which Class we know to be _empty_). Of this Pair of Converse Propositions, the first is undoubtedly _true_: the second, _as_ undoubtedly, _false_. It is always sad to see a batsman knock down his own wicket: one pities him, as a man and a brother, but, as a _cricketer_, one can but pronounce him "Out!" We see, then, that, among all the conceivable views we have here considered, there are only _two_ which can _logically_ be held, viz. _I_ and _A_ "assert", but _E_ does not. _E_ and _A_ "assert", but _I_ does not. The _second_ of these I have shown to involve great practical inconvenience. The _first_ is the one
