[See Note (C), p. 196.] Sec. 5. _Euler's Method of Diagrams._ Diagrams seem to have been used, at first, to represent _Propositions_ only. In Euler's well-known Circles, each was supposed to contain a class, and the Diagram consisted of two circles, which exhibited the relations, as to inclusion and exclusion, existing between the two Classes. _____ _/ ___ \_ / / y \ \ | \___/ | \_ x _/ \_____/ Thus, the Diagram, here given, exhibits the two Classes, whose respective Attributes are x and y, as so related to each other that the following Propositions are all simultaneously true:--"All x are y", "No x are not-y", "Some x are y", "Some y are not-x", "Some not-y are not-x", and, of course, the Converses of the last four. pg174 _____ _/ ___ \_ / / y \ \ | \___/ | \_ x _/ \_____/ Similarly, with this Diagram, the following Propositions are true:--"All y are x", "No
