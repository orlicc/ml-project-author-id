to use in an argument, is not in normal form, we must reduce it to such a form, before we can use it. pg009 A '=Proposition=,' when in normal form, asserts, as to certain two Classes, which are called its '=Subject=' and '=Predicate=,' either (1) that _some_ Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate; or (2) that _no_ Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate; or (3) that _all_ Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate. The Subject and the Predicate of a Proposition are called its '=Terms=.' Two Propositions, which convey the _same_ information, are said to be '=equivalent='. [Thus, the two Propositions, "I see John" and "John is seen by me," are equivalent.] Sec. 2. _Normal form of a Proposition._ A Proposition, in normal form, consists of four parts, viz.-- (1) The word "some," or "no," or "all." (This word, which tells us _how many_ Members of the Subject are also Members of the Predicate, is called the '=Sign of Quantity=.') (2) Name of Subject. (3) The verb "are" (or "is").
