all Things. The Class so formed (i.e. the Class "Things") contains the whole Universe. (2) We may think of the Class "Things," and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the Things which possess a certain Adjunct _not_ possessed by the whole Class. This Adjunct is said to be '=peculiar=' to the Class so formed. In this case, the Class "Things" is called a '=Genus=' with regard to the Class so formed: the Class, so formed, is called a '=Species=' of the Class "Things": and its peculiar Adjunct is called its '=Differentia='. pg002 As this Process is entirely _Mental_, we can perform it whether there _is_, or _is not_, an _existing_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct. If there _is_, the Class is said to be '=Real='; if not, it is said to be '=Unreal=', or '=Imaginary=.' [For example, we may imagine that we have picked out, from the Class "Things," all the Things which possess the Adjunct "material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets"; and we may thus form the Real Class "towns." Here we may regard "Things" as a _Genus_, "Towns" as a _Species_ of Things, and "material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets" as its
