of Premisses which are both of them Nullities, and which contain Unlike Eliminands. The simplest case is .---------------. .-------. xm_{0} + ym'_{0} |(O) | | |(O)| | | .---|---. | |---|---| | |(O)|(O)| | | | | |---|---|---|---| .-------. | | | | | | .---|---. | .'. xy_{0} |(O) | | .---------------. In this case we see that the Conclusion is a Nullity, and that the Retinends have kept their Signs. And we should find this Rule to hold good with _any_ Pair of Premisses which fulfil the given conditions. [The Reader had better satisfy himself of this, by working out, on Diagrams, several varieties, such as m_{1}x_{0} + ym'_{0} (which > xy_{0}) xm'_{0} + m_{1}y_{0} (which > xy_{0}) x'm_{0} + ym'_{0} (which > x'y_{0}) m'_{1}x'_{0} + m_{1}y'_{0} (which > x'y'_{0}).] If either Retinend is asserted in the _Premisses_ to exist, of course it may be so asserted in the _Conclusion_. Hence we get two _Variants_ of Fig. I, viz. (a) where _one_ Retinend is so asserted; (b) where _both_ are so asserted. [The Reader had better work out, on Diagrams, examples of these two Variants, such as m_{1}x_{0} + y_{1}m'_{0} (which proves y_{1}x_{0}) x_{1}m'_{0} + m_{1}y_{0} (which proves
