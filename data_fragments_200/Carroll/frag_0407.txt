It is evident that there are no boys in the School doing French: still we know, by the Rules, what would happen if there _were_ any. pg170 We are authorised, then, by the _Data_, to assert the following two Propositions:-- "If there were any boys doing French, all of them would be doing Greek; If there were any boys doing French, all of them would be doing Latin." And the Conclusion, according to "The Logicians" would be "If there were any boys doing Latin, some of them would be doing Greek."
