may be understood as asserting, or else as _not_ asserting, the existence of its Subject. (By "existence" I mean of course whatever kind of existence suits its nature. The two Propositions, "_dreams_ exist" and "_drums_ exist", denote two totally different kinds of "existence". A _dream_ is an aggregate of ideas, and exists only in the _mind of a dreamer_: whereas a _drum_ is an aggregate of wood and parchment, and exists in _the hands of a drummer_.) First, let us suppose that _I_ "asserts" (i.e. "asserts the existence of its Subject"). Here, of course, we must regard a Proposition in _A_ as making the _same_ assertion, since it necessarily _contains_ a Proposition in _I_. We now have _I_ and _A_ "asserting". Does this leave us free to make what supposition we choose as to _E_? My answer is "No. We are tied down to the supposition that _E_ does _not_ assert." This can be proved as follows:-- If possible, let _E_ "assert". Then (taking x, y, and z to represent Attributes) we see that, if the Proposition "No xy are z" be true, some things exist with the Attributes x and y: i.e. "Some x are y." pg167 Also we
