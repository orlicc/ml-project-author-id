For _six_ letters, Mr. Venn suggests that we might use _two_ Diagrams, like the above, one for the f-part, and the other for the not-f-part, of all the other combinations. "This", he says, "would give the desired 64 subdivisions." This, however, would only give 62 closed Compartments, and _one_ infinite area, which the two Classes, a'b'c'd'e'f and a'b'c'd'e'f', would have to share between them. Beyond _six_ letters Mr. Venn does not go. Sec. 7. _My Method of Diagrams._ My Method of Diagrams _resembles_ Mr. Venn's, in having separate Compartments assigned to the various Classes, and in marking these Compartments as _occupied_ or as _empty_; but it _differs_ from his Method, in assigning
