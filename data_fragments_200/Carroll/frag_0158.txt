_Differentia_. Again, we may imagine that we have picked out all the Things which possess the Adjunct "weighing a ton, easily lifted by a baby"; and we may thus form the _Imaginary_ Class "Things that weigh a ton and are easily lifted by a baby."] (3) We may think of a certain Class, _not_ the Class "Things," and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the Members of it which possess a certain Adjunct _not_ possessed by the whole Class. This Adjunct is said to be '=peculiar=' to the smaller Class so formed. In this case, the Class thought of is called a '=Genus=' with regard to the smaller Class picked out from it: the smaller Class is called a '=Species=' of the larger: and its peculiar Adjunct is called its '=Differentia='. [For example, we may think of the Class "towns," and imagine that we have picked out from it all the towns which possess the Attribute "lit with gas"; and we may thus form the Real Class "towns lit with gas." Here we may regard "Towns" as a _Genus_, "Towns lit with gas" as a _Species_ of Towns, and "lit with gas" as its _Differentia_. If,
