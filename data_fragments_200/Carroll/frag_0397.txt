One of the favourite objections, brought against the Science of Logic by its detractors, is that a Syllogism has no real validity as an argument, since it involves the Fallacy of _Petitio Principii_ (i.e. "Begging the Question", the essence of which is that the whole Conclusion is involved in _one_ of the Premisses). This formidable objection is refuted, with beautiful clearness and simplicity, by these three Diagrams, which show us that, in each of the three Figures, the Conclusion is really involved in the _two_ Premisses taken together, each contributing its share. Thus, in Fig. I., the Premiss xm_{0} empties the _Inner_ Cell of the N.W. Quarter, while the Premiss ym_{0} empties its _Outer_ Cell. Hence it needs the _two_ Premisses to empty the _whole_ of the N.W. Quarter, and thus to prove the Conclusion xy_{0}. Again, in Fig. II., the Premiss xm_{0} empties the Inner Cell of the N.W. Quarter. The Premiss ym_{1}
