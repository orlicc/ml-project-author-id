its predicate._ "Take, as an example, a syllogism in _Darapti_:-- '_All M is P_, _All M is S_, _.'. Some S is P_.' "Taking S, M, P, as the minor, middle, and major terms respectively, the conclusion will imply that, if there is an S, there is some P. Will the premisses also imply this? If so, then the syllogism is valid; but not otherwise. "The conclusion implies that if S exists P exists; but, consistently with the premisses, S may be existent while M and P are both non-existent. An implication is, therefore, contained in the conclusion, which is not justified by the premisses." This seems to _me_ entirely clear and convincing. Still, "to make sicker", I may as well throw the above (_soi-disant_) Syllogism into a concrete form, which will be within the grasp of even a _non_-logical Reader. Let us suppose that a Boys' School has been set up, with the following system of Rules:-- "All boys in the First (the highest) Class are to do French, Greek, and Latin. All in the Second Class are to do Greek only. All in the Third Class are to do Latin only." Suppose also that there _are_ boys in
