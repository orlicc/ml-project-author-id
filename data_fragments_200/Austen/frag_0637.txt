at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father, “Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?—Do, if it be possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.” “Is she unwell?” “No, no, not at all—only a little agitated. She would have ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you know—(nodding towards her father)—Humph!—Can you come?” “Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?—Is she really not ill?” “Depend upon me—but ask no more questions. You will know it all in time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!” To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something really important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her father, that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls.
