He is half way to Windsor by this time.” “Has your son been with you, then?” “Oh! yes—did not you know?—Well, well, never mind.” For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded and demure, “Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.” They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.—“Well, my dear,” said he, as they entered the room—“I have brought her, and now I hope you will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.”—And Emma distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,—“I have been as good as my word.

Something of a very unpleasant nature, I find, has occurred;—do let me know directly what it is.
