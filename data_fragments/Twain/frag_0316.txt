Saturday night?” “Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?—and _then_ it’s Sunday. Devils don’t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t reckon.” “I never thought of that. That’s so. Lemme go with you?” “Of course—if you ain’t afeard.” “Afeard! ’Tain’t likely. Will you meow?” “Yes—and you meow back, if you get a chance.
