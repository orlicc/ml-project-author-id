that gave him another idea, and he says: “Borrow a shirt, too.” “What do we want of a shirt, Tom?” “Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.” “Journal your granny—_Jim_ can’t write.” “S’pose he _can’t_ write—he can make marks on the shirt, can’t he, if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel-hoop?” “Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one; and quicker, too.” “_Prisoners_ don’t have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens out of, you muggins. They _always_ make their pens out of the hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they’ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall. _They_ wouldn’t use a goose-quill if they had it. It ain’t regular.” “Well, then, what’ll we make him the ink out of?” “Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that’s the common sort and women; the best authorities uses their own blood.
