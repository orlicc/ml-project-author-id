old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter. “Tom, what on earth ails that cat?” “I don’t know, aunt,” gasped the boy. “Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?” “Deed I don’t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they’re having a good time.” “They do, do they?” There was something in the tone that made Tom apprehensive. “Yes’m.
