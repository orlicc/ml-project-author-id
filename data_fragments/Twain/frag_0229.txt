a nigger, and wouldn’t understand the reasons for it, and how it’s the custom in Europe; so we’ll let it go. But there’s one thing—he can have a rope ladder; we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough. And we can send it to him in a pie; it’s mostly done that way. And I’ve et worse pies.” “Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,” I says; “Jim ain’t got no use for a rope ladder.” “He _has_ got use for it. How _you_ talk, you better say; you don’t know nothing about it. He’s _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.” “What in the nation can he _do_ with it?” “_Do_ with it? He can hide it in his bed, can’t he? That’s what they all do; and _he’s_ got to, too.

Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder? Why, it’s perfectly ridiculous.” “Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you’ll take my advice, you’ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.” He said that would do. And
