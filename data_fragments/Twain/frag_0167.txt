They haven’t got no conveniences for it.” “Oh, I see, now. You might a said that in the first place and saved time.” When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was comfortable and glad. Next, she says: “Do you go to church, too?” “Yes—regular.” “Where do you set?” “Why, in our pew.” “_Whose_ pew?” “Why, _ourn_—your Uncle Harvey’s.” “His’n?
