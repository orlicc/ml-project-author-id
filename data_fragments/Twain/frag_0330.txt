is.” There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly. Then Tom whispered: “Say, Hucky—do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?” “O’ course he does. Least his sperrit does.” Tom, after a pause: “I wish I’d said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody calls him Hoss.” “A body can’t be too partic’lar how they talk ’bout these-yer dead people, Tom.” This was a damper, and conversation died again. Presently Tom seized his comrade’s arm and said: “Sh!” “What is it, Tom?” And the two clung together with beating hearts. “Sh! There ’tis again! Didn’t you hear it?” “I—” “There! Now you hear it.” “Lord, Tom, they’re coming! They’re coming, sure. What’ll we do?” “I dono. Think they’ll see us?” “Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats.
