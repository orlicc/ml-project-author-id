That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money’s gone.” “_Sold_ him?” I says, and begun to cry; “why, he was _my_ nigger, and that was my money. Where is he?—I want my nigger.” “Well, you can’t _get_ your nigger, that’s all—so dry up your blubbering. Looky here—do you think _you’d_ venture to blow on us? Blamed if I think I’d trust you. Why, if you _was_ to blow on us—” He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before.

Just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along, and then you won’t get into trouble with _us_, d’ye hear?” That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I wanted to be left free to work my plans. “So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger—some idiots don’t require documents—leastways I’ve heard there’s such down South
