want to see my mother—and you would, too, if you had one. I ain’t any more baby than you are.” And Joe snuffled a little. “Well, we’ll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won’t we, Huck? Poor thing—does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here, don’t you, Huck? We’ll stay, won’t we?” Huck said, “Y-e-s”—without any heart in it. “I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live,” said Joe, rising. “There now!” And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself. “Who cares!” said Tom. “Nobody wants you to.

He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades, yelling: “Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!” They presently stopped and turned around.
