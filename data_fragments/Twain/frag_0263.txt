it shot him.” “Singular dream,” he says. So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. But when he sees the canoe he didn’t like the look of her—said she was big enough for one, but didn’t look pretty safe for two. I says: “Oh, you needn’t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy enough.” “What three?” “Why, me and Sid, and—and—and _the guns;_ that’s what I mean.” “Oh,” he says.

Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad for Tom, and I’ll dig out for the island right off. So away I shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas’s stomach! He says: “Why, _Tom!_ Where you been all this time, you rascal?” “_I_ hain’t been nowheres,” I says, “only just hunting for the
