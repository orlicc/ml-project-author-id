and all that blame foolishness. You see a pirate don’t have to do _anything_, Joe, when he’s ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and then he don’t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.” “Oh yes, that’s so,” said Joe, “but I hadn’t thought much about it, you know. I’d a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I’ve tried it.” “You see,” said Tom, “people don’t go much on hermits, nowadays, like they used to in old times, but a pirate’s always respected.

And the women’s always beautiful, too.” “And don’t they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver and di’monds,” said Joe, with enthusiasm. “Who?” said Huck. “Why, the pirates.” Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly. “I reckon I ain’t dressed fitten for a pirate,” said he, with
