won’t be hard to find. Now there was a voice—a very low voice—Injun Joe’s: “Damn her, maybe she’s got company—there’s lights, late as it is.” “I can’t see any.” This was that stranger’s voice—the stranger of the haunted house. A deadly chill went to Huck’s heart—this, then, was the “revenge” job! His thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn’t dare—they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed between the stranger’s remark and Injun Joe’s next—which was— “Because the bush is in your way. Now—this way—now you see, don’t you?” “Yes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.” “Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and maybe never have another chance.

When you want to get revenge on a woman you don’t kill her—bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils—you notch her ears like a sow!” “By God, that’s—” “Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I’ll tie her to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I’ll not cry, if she does. My friend, you’ll help me in this thing—for _my_ sake—that’s why you’re here—I mightn’t be able alone. If you flinch, I’ll kill you. Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I’ll kill her—and then I reckon nobody’ll ever know much about who done this business.” “Well, if it’s got to be done, let’s get at it.
