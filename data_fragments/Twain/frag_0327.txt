and looked. But it must have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each other. Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log, disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged, with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way and that. He said cautiously—to an imaginary company: “Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.” Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom. Tom called: “Hold!

The book says, ‘Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy of Guisborne.’ You’re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.” There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the whack and fell. “Now,” said Joe, getting up, “you got to let me kill _you_. That’s fair.” “Why, I can’t do that, it ain’t in the book.” “Well, it’s blamed mean—that’s all.” “Well, say, Joe, you
