orphans of _everything_ they had. “Why, how you talk!” says the king. “We sha’n’t rob ’em of nothing at all but jest this money. The people that _buys_ the property is the suff’rers; because as soon ’s it’s found out ’at we didn’t own it—which won’t be long after we’ve slid—the sale won’t be valid, and it’ll all go back to the estate.
