the crack. Quick!” “No, _you_, Tom!” “I can’t—I can’t _do_ it, Huck!” “Please, Tom. There ’tis again!” “Oh, lordy, I’m thankful!” whispered Tom. “I know his voice. It’s Bull Harbison.” * [* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of him as “Harbison’s Bull,” but a son or a dog of that name was “Bull Harbison.”] “Oh, that’s good—I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I’d a bet anything it was a _stray_ dog.” The dog howled again. The boys’ hearts sank once more. “Oh, my! that ain’t no Bull Harbison!” whispered Huckleberry. “_Do_, Tom!” Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack.
