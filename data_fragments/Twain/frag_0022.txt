could put in her shovel about a thing that ain’t none of her business?” “Nobody never told her.” “Well, I’ll learn her how to meddle. And looky here—you drop that school, you hear? I’ll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better’n what _he_ is. You lemme catch you fooling around that school again, you hear? Your mother couldn’t read, and she couldn’t write, nuther, before she died. None of the family couldn’t before _they_ died. _I_ can’t; and here you’re a-swelling yourself up like this.

Hey?—how’s that?” “They lie—that’s how.” “Looky here—mind how you talk to me; I’m a-standing about all I can stand now—so don’t gimme no sass. I’ve been in town two days, and I hain’t heard nothing but about you bein’ rich. I heard about it away down the river, too. That’s why I come.
