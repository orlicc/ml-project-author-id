a free man, en I couldn’t ever ben free ef it hadn’ ben for Huck; Huck done it. Jim won’t ever forgit you, Huck; you’s de bes’ fren’ Jim’s ever had; en you’s de _only_ fren’ ole Jim’s got now.” I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me.
