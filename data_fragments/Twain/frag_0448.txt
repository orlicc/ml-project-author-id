bits’ worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that’s human nature—hurry along, hurry along!” The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about. “Never mind; you’ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas’.” Huck said with some apprehension—for he was long used to being falsely accused: “Mr. Jones, we haven’t been doing nothing.” The Welshman laughed. “Well, I don’t know, Huck, my boy.

We’ll wait—come down when you are slicked up enough.” Then she left. CHAPTER XXXIV Huck said: “Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain’t high from the ground.” “Shucks! what do you want to slope for?” “Well, I ain’t used to that kind of a crowd. I can’t stand it. I ain’t going down there, Tom.” “Oh, bother!
