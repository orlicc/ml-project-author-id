it won’t do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says: “Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n. Well, I know what I’s gwyne to do: I’s gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin.” So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.
