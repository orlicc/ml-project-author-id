before we break down!” whispered Tom, in short catches between breaths. “I can’t stand it much longer.” Huckleberry’s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it. They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered: “Huckleberry, what do you reckon’ll come of this?” “If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging’ll come of it.” “Do you though?” “Why, I _know_ it, Tom.” Tom thought a while, then he said: “Who’ll tell? We?” “What are you talking about? S’pose something happened and Injun Joe _didn’t_ hang? Why, he’d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure as we’re a laying here.” “That’s just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.” “If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he’s fool enough.

You know that. That Injun devil wouldn’t make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak ’bout this and they didn’t hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to one another—that’s what we got to do—swear to keep mum.” “I’m agreed. It’s the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear that we—” “Oh no, that wouldn’t do for this. That’s good enough for little rubbishy common things—specially
