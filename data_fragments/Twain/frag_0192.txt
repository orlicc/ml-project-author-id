old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn’t read it. The lawyer looked powerful astonished, and says: “Well, it beats _me_”—and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man’s writing, and then _them_ again; and then says: “These old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here’s _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see _they_ didn’t write them” (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), “and here’s _this_ old gentleman’s hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn’t write them—fact is, the scratches he makes ain’t properly _writing_ at all. Now, here’s some letters from—” The new old gentleman says: “If you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my brother there—so he copies for me. It’s _his_ hand you’ve got there, not mine.” “_Well!_” says the lawyer, “this _is_ a state of things. I’ve got some of William’s letters, too; so if you’ll get him to write a line or so we can com—” “He _can’t_ write with his left hand,” says the old gentleman. “If he could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too. Look at both, please—they’re by the same hand.” The lawyer done it, and says: “I believe it’s so—and if it ain’t so, there’s a heap stronger resemblance than I’d noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well! I thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it’s gone to grass, partly. But anyway, _one_ thing is proved—_these_ two ain’t either of ’em Wilkses”—and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke. Well, what do you think? That muleheaded old fool wouldn’t give in _then!_ Indeed he wouldn’t. Said it warn’t no fair test. Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn’t _tried_ to write—_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying _himself;_ but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says: “I’ve thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br—helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?”
