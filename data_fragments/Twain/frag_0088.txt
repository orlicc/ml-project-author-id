so we took a smoke on it and waited. There warn’t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and not pass it without seeing it. He said he’d be mighty sure to see it, because he’d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it he’d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom. Every little while he jumps up and says: “Dah she is?” But it warn’t. It was Jack-o’-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before.
