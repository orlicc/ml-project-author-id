left o’ poor Hare-lip. So she hollered. “All right, then,” says the other girls; “you just ask his pardon.” She done it, too; and she done it beautiful. She done it so beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so she could do it again. I says to myself, this is _another_ one that I’m letting him rob her of her money. And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind’s made up; I’ll hive that money for them or bust. So then I lit out—for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.
