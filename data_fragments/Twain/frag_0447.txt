an awkward fashion, but could not carry it conveniently. “I thought so,” he said; “_They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day at the ha’nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of fetching the little bags along.” The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock. “Now less fetch the guns and things,” said Huck. “No, Huck—leave them there. They’re just the tricks to have when we go to robbing. We’ll keep them there all the time, and we’ll hold our orgies there, too. It’s an awful snug place for orgies.” “What orgies?” “I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we’ve got to have them, too. Come along, Huck, we’ve been in here a long time. It’s getting late, I reckon. I’m hungry, too.

Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting. Here—hurry up, trot ahead—I’ll haul the wagon for you. Why, it’s not as light as it might be. Got bricks in it?—or old metal?” “Old metal,” said Tom. “I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time hunting up six
