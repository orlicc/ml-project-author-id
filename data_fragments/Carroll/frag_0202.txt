any necessary contradiction with itself or with the accepted facts of Logic. But, when we come to _test_ it, as applied to the actual _facts_ of life, we shall find I think, that it fits in with them so badly that its adoption would be, to say the least of it, singularly inconvenient for ordinary folk. Let me record a little dialogue I have just held with my friend Jones, who is trying to form a new Club, to be regulated on strictly _Logical_ principles. _Author._ "Well, Jones! Have you got your new Club started yet?" _Jones_ (_rubbing his hands_). "You'll be glad to hear that some of the Members (mind, I only say '_some_') are millionaires! Rolling in gold, my boy!" _Author._ "That sounds well. And how many Members have entered?" _Jones_ (_staring_). "None at all. We haven't got it started yet. What makes you think we have?" _Author._ "Why, I thought you said that some of the Members----" pg168 _Jones_ (_contemptuously_). "You don't seem to be aware that we're working on strictly _Logical_ principles. A _Particular_ Proposition does _not_ assert the existence of its Subject. I merely meant to say that we've made a Rule not to admit _any_ Members till we have at least _three_ Candidates whose incomes are over ten thousand a year!" _Author._ "Oh, _that's_ what you meant, is it? Let's hear some more of your Rules." _Jones._ "Another is, that no one, who has been convicted seven times of forgery, is admissible." _Author._ "And here, again, I suppose you don't mean to assert there _are_ any such convicts in existence?" _Jones._ "Why, that's exactly what I _do_ mean to assert! Don't you know that a Universal Negative _asserts_ the existence of its Subject? _Of course_ we didn't make that Rule till we had satisfied ourselves that there are several such convicts now living." The Reader can now decide for himself how far this _second_ conceivable view would fit in with the facts of life. He will, I think, agree with me that Jones' view, of the 'Existential Import' of Propositions, would lead to some inconvenience. Thirdly, let us suppose that neither _I_ nor _E_ "asserts". Now the supposition that the two Propositions, "Some x are y" and "No x are not-y", do _not_ "assert", necessarily involves the supposition that "All x are y" does _not_ "assert", since it would be absurd to suppose that
