at any time when provisions ran short, to utilise the nursery-governess for the nursery-dinner!) Hence the Trio is a _Syllogism_; the Genus "creatures" is its 'Univ.'; the two Propositions, "All cats understand French" and "Some chickens are cats", are its _Premisses_, the Proposition "Some chickens understand French" is its _Conclusion_; the Terms "cats" and "cats" are its _Eliminands_; and the Terms, "creatures understanding French" and "chickens", are its _Retinends_. Hence we may write it thus:-- "All cats understand French; Some chickens are cats; .'. Some chickens understand French".] pg059 CHAPTER II. _PROBLEMS IN SYLLOGISMS._ Sec. 1. _Introductory._ When the Terms of a Proposition are represented by _words_, it is said to be '=concrete='; when by _letters_, '=abstract=.' To translate a Proposition from concrete into abstract form, we fix on a Univ., and regard each Term as a _Species_ of it, and we choose a letter to represent its _Differentia_. [For example, suppose we wish to translate "Some soldiers are brave" into abstract form. We may take "men" as Univ., and regard "soldiers" and "brave men" as _Species_ of the _Genus_ "men"; and we may choose x to represent the peculiar Attribute (say "military") of "soldiers," and y to represent "brave." Then the Proposition may be written "Some military men are brave men"; _i.e._ "Some x-men are y-men"; _i.e._ (omitting "men," as explained at p. 26) "Some x are y." In practice, we should merely say "Let Univ. be "men", x = soldiers, y = brave", and at once translate "Some soldiers are brave" into "Some x are y."] The Problems we shall have to solve are of two kinds, viz. (1) "Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them." (2) "Given a Trio of Propositions of Relation, of which every two contain a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as a Syllogism: to ascertain whether the proposed Conclusion is consequent from the proposed Premisses, and, if so, whether it is _complete_." These Problems we will discuss separately. pg060 Sec. 2. _Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them._ The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:-- (1) Determine the 'Universe
