the North-West Cell. .-------. |(.)| | |---|---| | | | .-------. We know that this represents each of the Trio of equivalent Propositions "Some xy exist" = "Some x are y" = "Some y are x". Similarly we may interpret a _Red_ Counter, when placed in the North-East, or South-West, or South-East Cell. Next, let us suppose that we find a _Grey_ Counter placed in the North-West Cell. .-------. |( )| | |---|---| | | | .-------. We know that this represents each of the Trio of equivalent Propositions "No xy exist" = "No x are y" = "No y are x".

We know that this represents the Proposition, "All x are y". [Note that the _Half_, occupied by the two Counters, settles what is to be the _Subject_ of the Proposition, and that the _Cell_, occupied by the _Red_ Counter, settles what is to be its _Predicate_.] pg038 Similarly we may interpret a _Red_
