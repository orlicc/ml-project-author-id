In the original book at the top of page 97, the following text occurred: [N.B. The numbers at the foot of each page indicate the pages where the corresponding matter may be found.] In accordance with the un-paged medium here this has been changed to: [N.B. Reference tags for Examples, Answers & Solutions will be found in the right margin.] The part of the book to which this relates contains, by sections, "Examples" (Exercises for the student), "Answers" (to the Examples) & "Solutions" (Worked Answers). All Example sections have corresponding Answer sections. For Sections 2 & 3, worked Solutions are not supplied; for Sections 4-7, Solutions are given by 2 different methods. In association with this, the original text contained editorial notes at the foot of each page giving the page numbers for the related Sections. In this version, these notes are replaced with marginal tags such as EX3, AN4, SL5, & SL6-A and SL7-B which are placed at the top of each Section to identify the current location. As with page tags, these may be searched for to locate the material referred to. (A search for "SL4" should find successively both "SL4-A" & "SL4-B".) These tags are unique regardless of case.
