(6) The Proposition now becomes "Some | farmers | are | persons who always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be." (9) "No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars." (1) The Subject is "lambs." (2) The Verb is "are." (3) The Predicate is "* * * accustomed &c." (4) Let Univ. be "animals." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "no." (6) The Proposition now becomes "No | lambs | are | animals accustomed to smoke cigars." (10) "I ca'n't understand examples that are not arranged in regular order, like those I am used to." (1) The Subject is "examples that," &c. (2) The Verb is "I ca'n't understand," which we must alter, so as to have "examples," instead of "I," as the nominative case. It may be expressed as "are not understood by me." (3) The Predicate is "* * * not understood by me." (4) Let Univ. be "examples." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "all." (6) The Proposition now becomes "All | examples that are not arranged in regular order like those I am used to | are | examples not understood by me."] pg017 Sec. 3. _A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", is a Double Proposition._ A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", asserts (as we already know) that "_All_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate". This evidently contains, as a _part_ of what it tells us, the smaller Proposition "_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate". [Thus, the Proposition "_All_ bankers are rich men" evidently contains the smaller Proposition "_Some_ bankers are rich men".] The question now arises "What is the _rest_ of the information which this Proposition gives us?" In order to answer this question, let us begin with the smaller Proposition, "_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate," and suppose that this is _all_ we have been told; and let us proceed to inquire what _else_ we need to be told, in order to know that "_All_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate". [Thus, we may suppose that the Proposition "_Some_ bankers are rich men" is all the information we possess; and we may proceed to inquire what _other_ Proposition needs to be added to it, in order to make up the entire Proposition "_All_ bankers are rich men".] Let us also suppose that the 'Univ.'
