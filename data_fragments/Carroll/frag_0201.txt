may be understood as asserting, or else as _not_ asserting, the existence of its Subject. (By "existence" I mean of course whatever kind of existence suits its nature. The two Propositions, "_dreams_ exist" and "_drums_ exist", denote two totally different kinds of "existence". A _dream_ is an aggregate of ideas, and exists only in the _mind of a dreamer_: whereas a _drum_ is an aggregate of wood and parchment, and exists in _the hands of a drummer_.) First, let us suppose that _I_ "asserts" (i.e. "asserts the existence of its Subject"). Here, of course, we must regard a Proposition in _A_ as making the _same_ assertion, since it necessarily _contains_ a Proposition in _I_. We now have _I_ and _A_ "asserting". Does this leave us free to make what supposition we choose as to _E_? My answer is "No. We are tied down to the supposition that _E_ does _not_ assert." This can be proved as follows:-- If possible, let _E_ "assert". Then (taking x, y, and z to represent Attributes) we see that, if the Proposition "No xy are z" be true, some things exist with the Attributes x and y: i.e. "Some x are y." pg167 Also we know that, if the Proposition "Some xy are z" be true, the same result follows. But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of them _must_ be true. Hence this result is _always_ true: i.e. the Proposition "Some x are y" is _always_ true! _Quod est absurdum._ (See Note (A), p. 195). We see, then, that the supposition "_I_ asserts" necessarily leads to "_A_ asserts, but _E_ does not". And this is the _first_ of the various views that may conceivably be held. Next, let us suppose that _I_ does _not_ "assert." And, along with this, let us take the supposition that _E_ _does_ "assert." Hence the Proposition "No x are y" means "Some x exist, and none of them are y": i.e. "_all_ of them are _not_-y," which is a Proposition in _A_. We also know, of course, that the Proposition "All x are not-y" proves "No x are y." Now two Propositions, each of which proves the other, are _equivalent_. Hence every Proposition in _A_ is equivalent to one in _E_, and therefore "_asserts_". Hence our _second_ conceivable view is "_E_ and _A_ assert, but _I_ does not." This view does not seen to involve
