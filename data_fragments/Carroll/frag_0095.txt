a _Red_ Counter, placed within a Cell, shall mean "This Cell is _occupied_" (i.e. "There is at least _one_ Thing in it"). Let us also agree that a _Red_ Counter, placed on the partition between two Cells, shall mean "The Compartment, made up of these two Cells, is _occupied_; but it is not known _whereabouts_, in it, its occupants are." Hence it may be understood to mean "At least _one_ of these two Cells is occupied: possibly _both_ are." Our ingenious American cousins have invented a phrase to describe the condition of a man who has not yet made up his mind _which_ of two political parties he will join: such a man is said to be "=sitting on the fence=." This phrase exactly describes the condition of the Red Counter. Let us also agree that a _Grey_ Counter, placed within a Cell, shall mean "This Cell is _empty_" (i.e. "There is _nothing_ in it"). [The Reader had better provide himself with 4 Red Counters and 5 Grey ones.] pg027 CHAPTER III. _REPRESENTATION OF PROPOSITIONS._ Sec. 1. _Introductory._ Henceforwards, in stating such Propositions as "Some x-Things exist" or "No x-Things are y-Things", I shall omit the word "Things", which the Reader can supply for himself, and shall write them as "Some x exist" or "No x are y". [Note that the word "Things" is here used with a special meaning, as explained at p. 23.] A Proposition, containing only _one_ of the Letters used as Symbols for Attributes, is said to be '=Uniliteral='. [For example, "Some x exist", "No y' exist", &c.] A Proposition, containing _two_ Letters, is said to be ='Biliteral'=. [For example, "Some xy' exist", "No x' are y", &c.] A Proposition is said to be '=in terms of=' the Letters it contains, whether with or without accents. [Thus, "Some xy' exist", "No x' are y", &c., are said to be _in terms of_ x and y.] pg028 Sec. 2. _Representation of Propositions of Existence._ Let us take, first, the Proposition "Some x exist". [Note that this Proposition is (as explained at p. 12) equivalent to "Some existing Things are x-Things."] This tells us that there is at least _one_ Thing in the North Half; that is, that the North Half is _occupied_. And this we can evidently represent by placing a _Red_ Counter (here represented by a _dotted_ circle) on the partition which divides the North Half.
