The Univ. is "persons." The Individual "I" may be regarded as a Class, of persons, whose peculiar Attribute is "represented by the Name 'I'", and may be called the Class of "I's". It is evident that this Class cannot possibly contain more than one Member: hence the Sign of Quantity is "all". The verb "have been" may be replaced by the phrase "are persons who have been".

The Proposition may be written "No | not-brave persons | are | persons deserving of the fair". 7. Univ. is
