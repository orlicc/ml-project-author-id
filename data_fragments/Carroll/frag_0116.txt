CHAPTER I. _INTRODUCTORY_ When a Trio of Biliteral Propositions of Relation is such that (1) all their six Terms are Species of the same Genus, (2) every two of them contain between them a Pair of codivisional Classes, (3) the three Propositions are so related that, if the first two were true, the third would be true, the Trio is called a '=Syllogism='; the Genus, of which each of the six Terms is a Species, is called its ='Universe of Discourse=', or, more briefly, its '=Univ.='; the first two Propositions are called its '=Premisses=', and the third its '=Conclusion='; also the Pair of codivisional Terms in the Premisses are called its '=Eliminands=', and the other two its '=Retinends='. The Conclusion of a Syllogism is said to be '=consequent=' from its Premisses: hence it is usual to prefix to it the word "Therefore" (or the Symbol ".'."). pg057 [Note that the 'Eliminands' are so called because they are _eliminated_, and do not appear in the Conclusion; and that the 'Retinends' are so called because they are _retained_, and _do_
