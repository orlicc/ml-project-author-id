books." .-------------------. | old | old | | English | foreign | | books | books | |---------|---------| | new | new | | English | foreign | | books | books | .-------------------. We have, in fact, assigned the four Quarters of the table to four different Classes of books, as here shown.] The Reader should carefully remember that, in such a phrase as "the x-Things," the word "Things" means that particular _kind_ of Things, to which the whole Diagram has been assigned. [Thus, if we say "Let Univ. be 'books'," we mean that we have assigned the whole Diagram to "books." In that case, if we took "x" to mean "old", the phrase "the x-Things" would mean "the old books."] The Reader should not go on to the next Chapter until he is _quite familiar_ with the _blank_ Diagram I have advised him to draw. He ought to be able to name, _instantly_, the _Adjunct_ assigned to any Compartment named in the right-hand column of the following Table. Also he ought to be able to name, _instantly_, the _Compartment_ assigned to any Adjunct named in the left-hand column. To make sure of this, he had better put the book into the hands of some genial friend, while he himself has nothing but the blank Diagram, and get that genial friend to question him on this Table, _dodging_ about as much as possible. The Questions and Answers should be something like this:-- pg025 TABLE I. .----------------------------------------. | _Adjuncts_ | _Compartments, or Cells,_ | | _of_ | _assigned to them._ | | _Classes._ | | |------------|---------------------------| | x | North Half. | | x' | South " | | y | West " | | y' | East " | |------------|---------------------------| | xy | North-West Cell. | | xy' | " East " | | x'y | South-West " | | x'y' | " East " | .----------------------------------------. Q. "Adjunct for West Half?" A. "y." Q. "Compartment for xy'?" A. "North-East Cell." Q. "Adjunct for South-West Cell?" A. "x'y." &c., &c. After a little practice, he will find himself able to do without the blank Diagram, and will be able to see it _mentally_ ("in my mind's eye, Horatio!") while answering the questions of his genial friend. When _this_ result has been reached, he may safely go on to the next Chapter. pg026 CHAPTER II. _COUNTERS._ Let us agree that
