beginning with "Some" and the other with "No", each of which we now know how to translate. [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules. (1) "Some apples are not ripe." Here we arrange thus:-- "Some" _Sign of Quantity_. "existing Things" _Subject_. "are" _Copula_. "not-ripe apples" _Predicate_. or thus:-- "Some | existing Things | are | not-ripe apples." pg021 (2) "Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be." Here we arrange thus:-- "Some | existing Things | are | farmers who always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be." (3) "No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars." Here we arrange thus:-- "No | existing Things |are | lambs accustomed to smoke cigars." (4) "None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent." Here we arrange thus:-- "No | existing Things | are | speculations of mine, which have brought me as much as 5 per cent." (5) "None but the brave deserve the fair." Here we note, to begin with, that the phrase "none but the brave" is equivalent to "no not-brave men." We then arrange thus:-- "No | existing Things | are | not-brave men deserving of the fair." (6) "All bankers are rich men." This is equivalent to the two Propositions "Some bankers are rich men" and "No bankers are poor men." Here we arrange thus:-- "Some | existing Things | are | rich bankers"; and "No | existing Things | are | poor bankers."] [Work Examples Sec. =1=, 1-4 (p. 97).] pg022 BOOK III. THE BILITERAL DIAGRAM. .-------------. | | | | xy | xy' | | | | |------|------| | | | | x'y | x'y' | | | | .-------------. CHAPTER I. _SYMBOLS AND CELLS._ First, let us suppose that the above Diagram is an enclosure assigned to a certain Class of Things, which we have selected as our 'Universe of Discourse.' or, more briefly, as our 'Univ'. [For example, we might say "Let Univ. be 'books'"; and we might imagine the Diagram to be a large table, assigned to all "books."] [The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, _not_ to refer to the above Diagram, but to draw a large one for himself, _without any letters_, and to have it by him while he reads, and keep his finger on that particular _part_ of it, about which he is reading.] pg023 Secondly,
