Let us take, lastly, the Double Proposition "Some x are y and some are y'", each part of which we already know how to represent. .-------. |(.)|(.)| |---|---| | | | .-------. Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions, "Some x' are y and some are y'", "Some y are x and some are x'", "Some y' are x and some are x'". The Reader should now get his genial friend to question him, severely, on these two Tables. The _Inquisitor_ should have the Tables before him: but the _Victim_ should have nothing but a blank Diagram, and the Counters with which he is to represent the various Propositions named by his friend, e.g. "Some y exist", "No y' are x", "All x are y", &c. &c. pg035 TABLE III. .-------------------------------------------------------------. | | .-------. | | .-------. | | Some xy exist | |(.)| | | | |(.)|( )| | | = Some x are y | |---|---| | All x are y | |---|---| | | = Some y are x | | | | | | | | | | | | .-------. | | .-------. | |------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------| | | .-------. | | .-------. | | Some xy' exist | | |(.)| | | |( )|(.)| | | = Some x are y' | |---|---| | All x are y' | |---|---| | | = Some y' are x | | | | | | | | | | | | .-------. | | .-------. | |------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------| | | .-------. | | .-------. | | Some x'y exist | | | | | | | | | | | = Some x' are y | |---|---| | All x' are y | |---|---| | | = Some y are x' | |(.)| | | | |(.)|( )| | | | .-------. | | .-------. | |------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------| | | .-------. | | .-------. | | Some x'y' exist | | | | | | | | | | | = Some x' are y'| |---|---| | All x' are y' | |---|---| | | = Some y' are x'| | |(.)| | | |( )|(.)| | | | .-------. | | .-------. | .-------------------------------------------------------------. .-------------------------------------------------------------. | | .-------. | | .-------. | | No xy exist | |( )| | | | |(.)| | | | = No x are y | |---|---| | All y are x
