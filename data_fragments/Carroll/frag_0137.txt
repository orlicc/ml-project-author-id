_Complete_ Conclusion; and for _them_ it will be easy enough to refer to the original list. pg092 [I will now go through the process of solving, by this method, the example worked in Sec. 2. The Data are 1 2 3 4 k_{1}l'_{0} + dh'_{0} + a_{1}c_{0} + b_{1}e'_{0} + 5 6 7 k'h_{0} + b'l_{0} + d'_{1}c'_{0} The Reader should take a piece of paper, and write out this solution for himself. The first line will consist of the above Data; the second must be composed, bit by bit, according to the following directions. We begin by writing down the first Premiss, with its numeral over it, but omitting the subscripts. We have now to find a Premiss which can be combined with this, _i.e._, a Premiss containing either k' or l. The first we find is No. 5; and this we tack on, with a +. To get the _Conclusion_ from these, k and k' must be eliminated, and what remains must be taken as one expression. So we _underscore_ them, putting a _single_ score under k, and a _double_ one under k'. The result we read as l'h. We must now find a Premiss containing either l or h'. Looking along the row, we fix on No. 2, and tack it on. Now these 3 Nullities are really equivalent to (l'h + dh'), in which h and h' must be eliminated, and what remains taken as one expression. So we _underscore_ them. The result reads as l'd. We now want a Premiss containing l or d'. No. 6 will do. These 4 Nullities are really equivalent to (l'd + b'l). So we underscore l' and l. The result reads as db'. We now want a Premiss containing d' or b. No. 4 will do. Here we underscore b' and b. The result reads as de'. We now want a Premiss containing d' or e. No. 7 will do. Here we underscore d and d'. The result reads as c'e'. We now want a Premiss containing c or e. No. 3 will do--in fact _must_ do, as it is the only one left. Here we underscore c' and c; and, as the whole thing now reads as e'a, we tack on e'a_{0} as the _Conclusion_, with a >. We now look along the row of Data, to see whether e' or a has been given as _existent_. We
