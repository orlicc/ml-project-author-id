/\_\/_/\ / \__\______/__/ For _five_ letters, "the simplest diagram I can suggest," Mr. Venn says, "is one like this (the small ellipse in the centre is to be regarded as a portion of the _outside_ of c; i.e. its four component portions are inside b and d but are no part of c). It must be admitted that such a diagram is not quite so simple to draw as one might wish it to be; but then consider what the alternative is of one undertakes to deal with five terms and all their combinations--nothing short of the disagreeable task of writing out, or in some way putting before us, all the 32 combinations involved." b c d ______ ____ ______ ______/_ \/ \/ _\______ a / / \ /\ /\ / \ \ e / / \ / \ / \ / \ \ / \ \/ \/ \/ / \ / \ /\ /\ /\ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ | \/ \/ __ \/ \/ | | /\ /\/ \/\ /\ | | / \ / /\ /\ \ / \ | | | \/ | \/ | \/ | | | | /\ | /\ | /\ | | | \ / \ \/ \/ / \ / | \ \/ \/\__/\/ \/ / \ /\ /\ /\ /\ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \/ \/ \/ \ / \ \ /\ /\ /\ / / \ \ / \ / \ / \ / / \ \/ \/ \/ \/ / \ /\____/\____/\____/\ / \ / \ / \| |/ \____________________/ pg176 This Diagram gives us 31 closed compartments. For _six_ letters, Mr. Venn suggests that we might use _two_ Diagrams, like the above, one for the f-part, and the other for the not-f-part, of all the other combinations. "This", he says, "would give the desired 64 subdivisions." This, however, would only give 62 closed Compartments, and _one_ infinite area, which the two Classes, a'b'c'd'e'f and a'b'c'd'e'f', would have to share between them. Beyond _six_ letters Mr. Venn does not go. Sec. 7. _My Method of Diagrams._ My Method of Diagrams _resembles_ Mr. Venn's, in having separate Compartments assigned to the various Classes, and in marking these Compartments as _occupied_ or as _empty_; but it _differs_ from his Method, in assigning
