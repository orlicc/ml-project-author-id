the same.] Also that "x_{0}" shall mean "No existing Things have the Attribute x", i.e. (more briefly) "No x exist"; also that "xy_{0}" shall mean "No xy exist", and so on. Such a Proposition may be called a '=Nullity='. Also that "+" shall mean "and". [Thus "ab_{1} + cd_{0}" means "Some ab exist and no cd exist".] Also that ">" shall mean "would, if true, prove". [Thus, "x_{0} > xy_{0}" means "The Proposition 'No x exist' would, if true, prove the Proposition 'No xy exist'".] When two Letters are both of them accented, or both _not_ accented, they are said to have '=Like Signs=', or to be '=Like=': when one is accented, and the other not, they are said to have '=Unlike Signs=', or to be '=Unlike='. pg071 CHAPTER II. _REPRESENTATION OF PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION._ Let us take, first, the Proposition "Some x are y". This, we know, is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence "Some xy exist". (See p. 31.) Hence it may be represented by the expression "xy_{1}". The Converse Proposition "Some y are x" may of course be represented by the _same_ expression, viz. "xy_{1}". Similarly we may represent the three similar Pairs of Converse Propositions, viz.-- "Some x are y'" = "Some y' are x", "Some x' are y" = "Some y are x'", "Some x' are y'" = "Some y' are x'". Let us take, next, the Proposition "No x are y". This, we know, is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence "No xy exist". (See p. 33.) Hence it may be represented by the expression "xy_{0}". The Converse Proposition "No y are x" may of course be represented by the _same_ expression, viz. "xy_{0}". Similarly we may represent the three similar Pairs of Converse Propositions, viz.-- "No x are y'" = "No y' are x", "No x' are y" = "No y are x'", "No x' are y'" = "No y' are x'". pg072 Let us take, next, the Proposition "All x are y". Now it is evident that the Double Proposition of Existence "Some x exist and no xy' exist" tells us that _some_ x-Things exist, but that _none_ of them have the Attribute y': that is, it tells us that _all_ of them have the Attribute y: that is, it tells us that "All x are y". Also it is evident that the expression "x_{1} + xy'_{0}" represents this Double Proposition. Hence
