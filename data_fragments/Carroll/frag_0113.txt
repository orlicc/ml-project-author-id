Then, representing "No y' are m" on the same Diagram, we get Diagram b. pg051 a b .---------------. .---------------. |(O) | (O)| |(O) | (O)| | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | | | | | | | |(O)| | |---|---|---|---| |---|---|---|---| | | | | | | | |(O)| | | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | | | | | | .---------------. .---------------. (2) "Some m are x; No m are y". If, neglecting the Rule, we were begin with "Some m are x", we should get Diagram a. And if we were then to take "No m are y", which tells us that the Inner N.W. Cell is _empty_, we should be obliged to take the "I" off the fence (as it no longer has the choice of _two_ Cells), and to put it into the Inner N.E. Cell, as in Diagram c. This trouble may be saved by beginning with "No m are y", as in Diagram b. And _now_, when we take "Some m are x", there is no fence to sit on! The "I" has to go, at once, into the N.E. Cell, as in Diagram c. a b c .---------------. .---------------. .---------------. | | | | | | | | | | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | | (I) | | | |(O)| | | | |(O)|(I)| | |---|---|---|---| |---|---|---|---| |---|---|---|---| | | | | | | |(O)| | | | |(O)| | | | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | | | | | | | | | .---------------. .---------------. .---------------. (3) "No x' are m'; All m are y". Here we begin by breaking up the Second into the two Propositions to which it is equivalent. Thus we have _three_ Propositions to represent, viz.-- (1) "No x' are m'; (2) Some m are y; (3) No m are y'". These we will take in the order 1, 3, 2. First we take No. (1), viz. "No x' are m'". This gives us Diagram a. pg052 Adding to this, No. (3), viz. "No m are y'", we get Diagram b. This time the "I", representing No. (2), viz. "Some m are y," has to sit on the fence, as there is no "O" to order it off! This gives us Diagram c. a b c .---------------. .---------------. .---------------. | | | | | | |
