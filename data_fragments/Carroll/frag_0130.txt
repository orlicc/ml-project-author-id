students are learned; and all ignorant students are idle." (4) [see p. 66] "All soldiers are strong; All soldiers are brave. Some strong men are brave." Univ. "men"; m = soldiers; x = strong; y = brave. m_{1}x'_{0} + m_{1}y'_{0} > xy_{1} [Fig. III. Hence proposed Conclusion is right. (5) [see p. 67] "I admire these pictures; When I admire anything, I wish to examine it thoroughly. I wish to examine some of these pictures thoroughly." Univ. "things"; m = admired by me; x = these; y = things which I wish to examine thoroughly. x_{1}m'_{0} + m_{1}y'_{0} > x_{1}y'_{0} [Fig. I (a). Hence proposed Conclusion, xy_{1}, is _incomplete_, the _complete_ one being "I wish to examine _all_ these pictures thoroughly." pg080 (6) [see p. 67] "None but the brave deserve the fair; Some braggarts are cowards. Some braggarts do not deserve the fair." Univ. "persons"; m = brave; x = deserving of the fair; y = braggarts. m'x_{0} + ym'_{1} > x'y_{1} [Fig. II. Hence proposed Conclusion is right. (7) [see p. 69] "No one, who means to go by the train and cannot get a conveyance, and has not enough time to walk to the station, can do without running; This party of tourists mean to go by the train and cannot get a conveyance, but they have plenty of time to walk to the station. This party of tourists need not run." Univ. "persons meaning to go by the train, and unable to get a conveyance"; m = having enough time to walk to the station; x = needing to run; y = these tourists. m'x'_{0} + y_{1}m'_{0} do not come under any of the three Figures. Hence it is necessary to return to the Method of Diagrams, as shown at p. 69. Hence there is no Conclusion.

When each of the proposed Premisses is a Proposition
