(2) If there be _no_ Conclusion, say so. (3) If there _be_ a Conclusion, compare it with the proposed Conclusion, and pronounce accordingly. I will now work out, in their briefest form, as models for the Reader to imitate in working examples, six Problems. (1) "All soldiers are strong; All soldiers are brave. Some strong men are brave."
