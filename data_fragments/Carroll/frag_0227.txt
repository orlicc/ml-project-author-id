as follows:-- With regard to the relationship existing between the Class 'xy' and the two Classes 'z' and 'not-z', there are _four_ conceivable states of things, viz. (1) Some xy are z, and some are not-z; (2) " " none " (3) No xy " some " (4) " " none " Of these four, No. (2) is equivalent to "All xy are z", No. (3) is equivalent to "All xy are not-z", and No. (4) is equivalent to "No xy exist." Now it is quite undeniable that, of these _four_ states of things, each is, _a priori_, _possible_, some _one must_ be true, and the other three _must_ be false. Hence the Contradictory to (2) is "Either (1) or (3) or (4) is true." Now the assertion "Either (1) or (3) is true" is equivalent to "Some xy are not-z"; and the assertion "(4) is true" is equivalent to "No xy exist." Hence the Contradictory to "All xy are z" may be expressed as the Alternative Proposition "Either some xy are not-z, or no xy exist," but _not_ as the Categorical Proposition "Some y are not-z." pg196 (B) [See p. 171, at end of Section 2.] There are yet _other_ views current among "The Logicians", as to the "Existential Import" of Propositions, which have not been mentioned in this Section. One is, that the Proposition "some x are y" is to be interpreted, neither as "Some x _exist_ and are y", nor yet as "If there _were_ any x in existence, some of them _would_ be y", but merely as "Some x _can be_ y; i.e. the Attributes x and y are _compatible_". On _this_ theory, there would be nothing offensive in my telling my friend Jones "Some of your brothers are swindlers"; since, if he indignantly retorted "What do you _mean_ by such insulting language, you scoundrel?", I should calmly reply "I merely mean that the thing is _conceivable_----that some of your brothers _might possibly_ be swindlers". But it may well be doubted whether such an explanation would _entirely_ appease the wrath of Jones! Another view is, that the Proposition "All x are y" _sometimes_ implies the actual _existence_ of x, and _sometimes_ does _not_ imply it; and that we cannot tell, without having it in _concrete_ form, _which_ interpretation we are to give to it. _This_ view is, I think, strongly supported by common usage; and it
