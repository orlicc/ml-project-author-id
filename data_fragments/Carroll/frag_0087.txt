if it contains a Substantive), there is no need to determine the 'Univ.'; but, if either Name is _incompletely expressed_, and contains _Attributes_ only, it is then necessary to determine a 'Univ.', in order to insert its Name as the Substantive. (5) Ascertain the _Sign of Quantity_; (6) Arrange in the following order:-- Sign of Quantity, Subject, Copula, Predicate. [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules. (1) "Some apples are not ripe." (1) The Subject is "apples." (2) The Verb is "are." (3) The Predicate is "not-ripe * * *." (As no Substantive is expressed, and we have not yet settled what the Univ. is to be, we are forced to leave a blank.) (4) Let Univ. be "fruit." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "some." (6) The Proposition now becomes "Some | apples | are | not-ripe fruit." pg014 (2) "None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent." (1) The Subject is "my speculations." (2) The Verb is "have brought," for which we substitute the phrase "are * * * that have brought". (3) The Predicate is "* * * that have brought &c." (4) Let Univ. be "transactions." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "none of." (6) The Proposition now becomes "None of | my speculations | are | transactions that have brought me as much as 5 per cent." (3) "None but the brave deserve the fair." To begin with, we note that the phrase "none but the brave" is equivalent to "no _not_-brave." (1) The Subject has for its _Attribute_ "not-brave." But no _Substantive_ is supplied. So we express the Subject as "not-brave * * *." (2) The Verb is "deserve," for which we substitute the phrase "are deserving of". (3) The Predicate is "* * * deserving of the fair." (4) Let Univ. be "persons." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "no." (6) The Proposition now becomes "No | not-brave persons | are | persons deserving of the fair." (4) "A lame puppy would not say "thank you" if you offered to lend it a skipping-rope." (1) The Subject is evidently "lame puppies," and all the rest of the sentence must somehow be packed into the Predicate. (2) The Verb is "would not say," &c., for which we may substitute the phrase "are not grateful for." (3) The Predicate may be expressed as "* * * not
