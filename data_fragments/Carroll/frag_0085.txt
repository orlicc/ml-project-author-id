"Some", is said to be '=Particular=.' It is also called 'a Proposition =in I=.' [Note, that it is called 'Particular,' because it refers to a _part_ only of the Subject.] A Proposition, that begins with "No", is said to be '=Universal Negative=.' It is also called 'a Proposition =in E=.' A Proposition, that begins with "All", is said to be '=Universal Affirmative=.' It is also called 'a Proposition =in A=.' [Note, that they are called 'Universal', because they refer to the _whole_ of the Subject.] A Proposition, whose Subject is an _Individual_, is to be regarded as _Universal_. [Let us take, as an example, the Proposition "John is not well". This of course implies that there is an _Individual_, to whom the speaker refers when he mentions "John", and whom the listener _knows_ to be referred to. Hence the Class "men referred to by the speaker when he mentions 'John'" is a one-Member Class, and the Proposition is equivalent to "_All_ the men, who are referred to by the speaker when he mentions 'John', are not well."] Propositions are of two kinds, 'Propositions of Existence' and 'Propositions of Relation.' These shall be discussed separately. pg011 CHAPTER II. _PROPOSITIONS OF EXISTENCE._ A '=Proposition of Existence=', when in normal form, has, for its _Subject_, the Class "existing Things". Its Sign of Quantity is "Some" or "No". [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_ existing Things are Members of its Predicate, it does _not_ tell us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with _two_ numbers, which are, in ascending order, "0" and "1 or more."] It is called "a Proposition of Existence" because its effect is to assert the _Reality_ (i.e. the real _existence_), or else the _Imaginariness_, of its Predicate. [Thus, the Proposition "Some existing Things are honest men" asserts that the Class "honest men" is _Real_. This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms:-- (1) "Honest men exist"; (2) "Some honest men exist"; (3) "The Class 'honest men' exists"; (4) "There are honest men"; (5) "There are some honest men". Similarly, the Proposition "No existing Things are men fifty feet high" asserts that the Class "men 50 feet high" is _Imaginary_. This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms:-- (1) "Men 50 feet high do
