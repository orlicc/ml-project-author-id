One of the favourite objections, brought against the Science of Logic by its detractors, is that a Syllogism has no real validity as an argument, since it involves the Fallacy of _Petitio Principii_ (i.e. "Begging the Question", the essence of which is that the whole Conclusion is involved in _one_ of the Premisses). This formidable objection is refuted, with beautiful clearness and simplicity, by these three Diagrams, which show us that, in each of the three Figures, the Conclusion is really involved in the _two_ Premisses taken together, each contributing its share. Thus, in Fig. I., the Premiss xm_{0} empties the _Inner_ Cell of the N.W. Quarter, while the Premiss ym_{0} empties its _Outer_ Cell. Hence it needs the _two_ Premisses to empty the _whole_ of the N.W. Quarter, and thus to prove the Conclusion xy_{0}. Again, in Fig. II., the Premiss xm_{0} empties the Inner Cell of the N.W. Quarter. The Premiss ym_{1} merely tells us that the Inner Portion of the W. Half is _occupied_, so that we may place a 'I' in it, _somewhere_; but, if this were the _whole_ of our information, we should not know in _which_ Cell to place it, so that it would have to 'sit on the fence': it is only when we learn, from the other Premiss, that the _upper_ of these two Cells is _empty_, that we feel authorised to place the 'I' in the _lower_ Cell, and thus to prove the Conclusion x'y_{1}. Lastly, in Fig. III., the information, that m _exists_, merely authorises us to place a 'I' _somewhere_ in the Inner Square----but it has large choice of fences to sit upon! It needs the Premiss xm_{0} to drive it out of the N. Half of that Square; and it needs the Premiss ym_{0} to drive it out of the W. Half. Hence it needs the _two_ Premisses to drive it into the Inner Portion of the S.E. Quarter, and thus to prove the Conclusion x'y'_{1}. pg165 APPENDIX, ADDRESSED TO TEACHERS.
