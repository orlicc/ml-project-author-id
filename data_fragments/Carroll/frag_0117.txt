appear in the Conclusion. Note also that the question, whether the Conclusion is or is not _consequent_ from the Premisses, is not affected by the _actual_ truth or falsity of any of the Trio, but depends entirely on their _relationship to each other_. As a specimen-Syllogism, let us take the Trio "No x-Things are m-Things; No y-Things are m'-Things. No x-Things are y-Things." which we may write, as explained at p. 26, thus:-- "No x are m; No y are m'. No x are y". Here the first and second contain the Pair of codivisional Classes m and m'; the first and third contain the Pair x and x; and the second and third contain the Pair y and y. Also the three Propositions are (as we shall see hereafter) so related that, if the first two were true, the third would also be true. Hence the Trio is a _Syllogism_; the two Propositions, "No x are m" and "No y are m'", are its _Premisses_; the Proposition "No x are y" is its _Conclusion_; the Terms m and m' are its _Eliminands_; and the Terms x and y are its _Retinends_. Hence we may write it thus:-- "No x are m; No y are m'. .'. No x are y". As a second specimen, let us take the Trio "All cats understand French; Some chickens are cats. Some chickens understand French". These, put into normal form, are "All cats are creatures understanding French; Some chickens are cats. Some chickens are creatures understanding French". Here all the six Terms are Species of the Genus "creatures." Also the first and second Propositions contain the Pair of codivisional Classes "cats" and "cats"; the first and third contain the Pair "creatures understanding French" and "creatures understanding French"; and the second and third contain the Pair "chickens" and "chickens". pg058 Also the three Propositions are (as we shall see at p. 64) so related that, if the first two were true, the third would be true. (The first two are, as it happens, _not_ strictly true in _our_ planet. But there is nothing to hinder them from being true in some _other_ planet, say _Mars_ or _Jupiter_--in which case the third would _also_ be true in that planet, and its inhabitants would probably engage chickens as nursery-governesses. They would thus secure a singular _contingent_ privilege, unknown in England, namely, that they would be able,
