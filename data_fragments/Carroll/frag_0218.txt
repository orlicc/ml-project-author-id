this discovery to a Sorites. If we assume (as surely we may?) that he is the _same_ man as that transcendent genius who first noticed that 4 times 5 is the same thing as 5 times 4, we may apply to him what somebody (Edmund Yates, I think it was) has said of Tupper, viz., "here is a man who, beyond all others of his generation, has been favoured with Glimpses of the Obvious!" These puerile----not to say infantine----forms of a Sorites I have, in this book, ignored from the very first, and have not only admitted freely Propositions in _E_, but have purposely stated the Premisses in random order, leaving to the Reader the useful task of arranging them, for himself, in an order which can be worked as a series of regular Syllogisms. In doing this, he can begin with _any one_ of them he likes. I have tabulated, for curiosity, the various orders in which the Premisses of the Aristotelian Sorites 1. All a are b; 2. All b are c; 3. All c are d; 4. All d are e; 5. All e are h. .'. All a are h. may be syllogistically arranged, and I find there are no less than _sixteen_ such orders, viz., 12345, 21345, 23145, 23415, 23451, 32145, 32415, 32451, 34215, 34251, 34521, 43215, 43251, 43521, 45321, 54321. Of these the _first_ and the _last_ have been dignified with names; but the other _fourteen_----first enumerated by an obscure Writer on Logic, towards the end of the Nineteenth Century----remain without a name! pg185 Sec. 10. _Some account of Parts II, III._ In Part II. will be found some of the matters mentioned in this Appendix, viz., the "Existential Import" of Propositions, the use of a _negative_ Copula, and the theory that "two negative Premisses prove nothing." I shall also extend the range of Syllogisms, by introducing Propositions containing alternatives (such as "Not-all x are y"), Propositions containing 3 or more Terms (such as "All ab are c", which, taken along with "Some bc' are d", would prove "Some d are a'"), &c. I shall also discuss Sorites containing Entities, and the _very_ puzzling subjects of Hypotheticals and Dilemmas. I hope, in the course of Part II., to go over all the ground usually traversed in the text-books used in our Schools and Universities, and to enable my Readers to solve Problems of the
