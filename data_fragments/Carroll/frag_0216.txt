On examination we find that Figs. 5, 10, 13 express the relation of entire mutual exclusion; that Figs. 6, 11 express partial inclusion and partial exclusion; that Fig. 7 expresses coincidence; that Figs. 8, 12 express entire inclusion of x in y; and that Fig. 9 expresses entire inclusion of y in x. pg182 We thus get five Biliteral Diagrams for x and y, viz. 14 _____ _____ _/ \_ _/ \_ / \ / \ | x | | y | \_ _/ \_ _/ \_____/ \_____/ 15 _____ _____ _/ \_/ \_ / / \ \ | x | | y | \_ \_/ _/ \_____/ \_____/ 16 _____ _/ \_ / \ | xy | \_ _/ \_____/ 17 _____ _/ ___ \_ / / x \ \ | \___/ | \_ y _/ \_____/ 18 _____ _/ ___ \_ / / y \ \ | \___/ | \_ x _/ \_____/ where the only Proposition, represented by them all, is "Some not-y are not-x," i.e. "Some persons, who are not gamblers, are not philosophers"----a result which Euler would hardly have regarded as a _valuable_ one, since he seems to have assumed that a Proposition of this form is _always_ true!

Then, as some my' is to be saved, it must clearly be my'x'. That is, there must exist my'x'; or eliminating m, y'x'. In common phraseology, 'Some y' are x',' or, 'Some not-gamblers are not-philosophers.'" pg183 (5) _Solution by my
