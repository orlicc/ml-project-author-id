not exist"; (2) "No men 50 feet high exist"; (3) "The Class 'men 50 feet high' does not exist"; (4) "There are not any men 50 feet high"; (5) "There are no men 50 feet high."] pg012 CHAPTER III. _PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION._ Sec. 1. _Introductory._ A =Proposition of Relation=, of the kind to be here discussed, has, for its Terms, two Specieses of the same Genus, such that each of the two Names conveys the idea of some Attribute _not_ conveyed by the other. [Thus, the Proposition "Some merchants are misers" is of the right kind, since "merchants" and "misers" are Specieses of the same Genus "men"; and since the Name "merchants" conveys the idea of the Attribute "mercantile", and the name "misers" the idea of the Attribute "miserly", each of which ideas is _not_ conveyed by the other Name. But the Proposition "Some dogs are setters" is _not_ of the right kind, since, although it is true that "dogs" and "setters" are Specieses of the same Genus "animals", it is _not_ true that the Name "dogs" conveys the idea of any Attribute not conveyed by the Name "setters". Such Propositions will be discussed in Part II.] The Genus, of which the two Terms are Specieses, is called the '=Universe of Discourse=,' or (more briefly) the '=Univ.=' The Sign of Quantity is "Some" or "No" or "All". [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_ Members of its Subject are _also_ Members of its Predicate, it does not tell us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with _three_ numbers, which are, in ascending order, "0", "1 or more", "the total number of Members of the Subject".] It is called "a Proposition of Relation" because its effect is to assert that a certain _relationship_ exists between its Terms. pg013 Sec. 2. _Reduction of a Proposition of Relation to Normal form._ The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:-- (1) Ascertain what is the _Subject_ (i.e., ascertain what Class we are _talking about_); (2) If the verb, governed by the Subject, is _not_ the verb "are" (or "is"), substitute for it a phrase beginning with "are" (or "is"); (3) Ascertain what is the _Predicate_ (i.e., ascertain what Class it is, which is asserted to contain _some_, or _none_, or _all_, of the Members of the Subject); (4) If the Name of each Term is _completely expressed_ (i.e.
