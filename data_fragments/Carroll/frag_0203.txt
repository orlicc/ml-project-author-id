they assert, when combined, more than they do when taken separately. Hence the _third_ (and last) of the conceivable views is that neither _I_, nor _E_, nor _A_, "asserts". The advocates of this third view would interpret the Proposition "Some x are y" to mean "If there _were_ any x in existence, some of them _would_ be y"; and so with _E_ and _A_. It admits of proof that this view, as regards _A_, conflicts with the accepted facts of Logic. Let us take the Syllogism _Darapti_, which is universally accepted as valid. Its form is "All m are x; All m are y. .'. Some y are x". pg169 This they would interpret as follows:-- "If there were any m in existence, all of them would be x; If there were any m in existence, all of them would be y. .'. If there were any y in existence, some of them would be x". That this Conclusion does _not_ follow has been so briefly and clearly explained by Mr. Keynes (in his "Formal Logic", dated 1894, pp. 356, 357), that I prefer to quote his words:-- "_Let no proposition imply the existence either of its subject or of its predicate._ "Take, as an example, a syllogism in _Darapti_:-- '_All M is P_, _All M is S_, _.'. Some S is P_.' "Taking S, M, P, as the minor, middle, and major terms respectively, the conclusion will imply that, if there is an S, there is some P. Will the premisses also imply this? If so, then the syllogism is valid; but not otherwise. "The conclusion implies that if S exists P exists; but, consistently with the premisses, S may be existent while M and P are both non-existent. An implication is, therefore, contained in the conclusion, which is not justified by the premisses." This seems to _me_ entirely clear and convincing. Still, "to make sicker", I may as well throw the above (_soi-disant_) Syllogism into a concrete form, which will be within the grasp of even a _non_-logical Reader. Let us suppose that a Boys' School has been set up, with the following system of Rules:-- "All boys in the First (the highest) Class are to do French, Greek, and Latin. All in the Second Class are to do Greek only. All in the Third Class are to do Latin only." Suppose also that there _are_ boys in
