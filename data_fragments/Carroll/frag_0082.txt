(or phrase), which conveys the idea of a Thing, _with_ the idea of an Adjunct represents _any_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct; i.e., it represents any Member of the Class to which that Adjunct is _peculiar_. Such a word (or phrase) is called a '=Name='; and, if there be an existing Thing which it represents, it is said to be a Name of that Thing. [For example, the words "Thing," "Treasure," "Town," and the phrases "valuable Thing," "material artificial Thing consisting of houses and streets," "Town lit with gas," "Town paved with gold," "old English Book."] Just as a Class is said to be _Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there _is_, or _is not_, an existing Thing in it, so also a Name is said to be _Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there _is_, or _is not_, an existing Thing represented by it. [Thus, "Town lit with gas" is a _Real_ Name: "Town paved with gold" is an _Unreal_ Name.] Every Name is either a Substantive only, or else a phrase consisting of a Substantive and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives). Every Name, except "Thing", may usually be expressed in three different forms:-- (_a_) The Substantive "Thing", and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives) conveying the ideas of the Attributes; pg005 (_b_) A Substantive, conveying the idea of a Thing with the ideas of _some_ of the Attributes, and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives) conveying the ideas of the _other_ Attributes; (_c_) A Substantive conveying the idea of a Thing with the ideas of _all_ the Attributes. [Thus, the phrase "material living Thing, belonging to the Animal Kingdom, having two hands and two feet" is a Name expressed in Form (_a_). If we choose to roll up together the Substantive "Thing" and the Adjectives "material, living, belonging to the Animal Kingdom," so as to make the new Substantive "Animal," we get the phrase "Animal having two hands and two feet," which is a Name (representing the same Thing as before) expressed in Form (_b_). And, if we choose to roll up the whole phrase into one word, so as to make the new Substantive "Man," we get a Name (still representing the very same Thing) expressed in Form (_c_).] A Name, whose Substantive is in the _plural_ number, may be used to represent either (1) Members of a Class,
