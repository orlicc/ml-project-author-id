will take it into your favourable consideration.’ Silence between them. The deadly statistical clock very hollow. The distant smoke very black and heavy. ‘Father,’ said Louisa, ‘do you think I love Mr. Bounderby?’ Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question. ‘Well, my child,’ he returned, ‘I—really—cannot take upon myself to say.’ ‘Father,’ pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before, ‘do you ask me to love Mr. Bounderby?’ ‘My dear Louisa, no. No. I ask nothing.’ ‘Father,’ she still pursued, ‘does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him?’ ‘Really, my dear,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, ‘it is difficult to answer your question—’ ‘Difficult to answer it, Yes or No, father? ‘Certainly, my dear.

Now, what are the Facts of this case? You are, we will say in round numbers, twenty years of age; Mr. Bounderby is, we will say in round numbers, fifty. There is some disparity in your respective years, but in your means and positions there is none; on the contrary, there is a great suitability. Then the question arises, Is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage? In considering this question, it is not unimportant to take into account
