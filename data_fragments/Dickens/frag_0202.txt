‘Besides which,’ said Mr. Harthouse, taking a turn or two across the room, dubiously, ‘it’s so alarmingly absurd. It would make a man so ridiculous, after going in for these fellows, to back out in such an incomprehensible way.’ ‘I am quite sure,’ repeated Sissy, ‘that it is the only reparation in your power, sir.
