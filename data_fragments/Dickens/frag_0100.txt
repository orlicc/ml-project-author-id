with a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality, ‘that I _should_ be scrupulously true, if I allowed names to be mentioned under this roof, that are unfortunately—most unfortunately—no doubt of that—connected with his.’ Bitzer knuckled his forehead again, and again begged pardon. ‘No, Bitzer,’ continued Mrs. Sparsit, ‘say an individual, and I will hear you; say Mr. Thomas, and you must excuse me.’ ‘With the usual exception, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, trying back, ‘of an individual.’ ‘Ah—h!’ Mrs. Sparsit repeated the ejaculation, the shake of the head over her tea-cup, and the long gulp, as taking up the conversation again at the point where it had been interrupted. ‘An individual, ma’am,’ said Bitzer, ‘has never been what he ought to have been, since he first came into the place.
