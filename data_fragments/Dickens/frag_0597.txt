it. It’s been trouble enough to get; I thought I should have been here, three hours ago.” Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard, sat down again without speaking. But he did not take his eyes off the robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over against each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his lips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright. “Wot now?” cried Sikes. “Wot do you look at a man so for?” Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the moment gone. “Damme!” said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm. “He’s gone mad.
