to behold. When they had encountered each other’s glance several times in this way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence. “Were you looking for me,” he said, “when you peered in at the window?” “Not that I am aware of, unless you’re Mr.—” Here Mr. Bumble stopped short; for he was curious to know the stranger’s name, and thought in his impatience, he might supply the blank. “I see you were not,” said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth; “or you have known my name.

You like it so, I suppose?” “Not too strong,” replied Mr. Bumble,
