I mun turn my face fro Coketown fur th’ time, and seek a fort’n, dear, by beginnin fresh.’ ‘Where will you go, Stephen?’ ‘I donno t’night,’ said he, lifting off his hat, and smoothing his thin hair with the flat of his hand. ‘But I’m not goin t’night, Rachael, nor yet t’morrow. ’Tan’t easy overmuch t’ know wheer t’ turn, but a good heart will coom to me.’ Herein, too, the sense of even thinking unselfishly aided him.
