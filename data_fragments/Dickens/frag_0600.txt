Bill!” cried Fagin, following him hastily. “A word. Only a word.” The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door: on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence, when the Jew came panting up. “Let me out,” said Sikes. “Don’t speak to me; it’s not safe.
