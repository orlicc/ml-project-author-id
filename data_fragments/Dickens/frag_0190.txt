Even when their eyes had met, and her sister had approached the bed, Louisa lay for minutes looking at her in silence, and suffering her timidly to hold her passive hand, before she asked: ‘When was I brought to this room?’ ‘Last night, Louisa.’ ‘Who brought me here?’ ‘Sissy, I believe.’ ‘Why do you believe so?’ ‘Because I found her here this morning.
