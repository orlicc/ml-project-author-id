don’t athk to know any thecreth, but I thuppothe I may conthider thith to be Mith Thquire.’ ‘This is his sister. Yes.’ ‘And t’other on’th daughter. That’h what I mean. Hope I thee you well, mith. And I hope the Thquire’th well?’ ‘My father will be here soon,’ said Louisa, anxious to bring him to the point. ‘Is my brother safe?’ ‘Thafe and thound!’ he replied. ‘I want you jutht to take a peep at the Ring, mith, through here.
