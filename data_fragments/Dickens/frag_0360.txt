If I go, you go; so take care of me.” “Well, well, my dear,” said the Jew, “I know all that; we—we—have a mutual interest, Bill,—a mutual interest.” “Humph,” said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the Jew’s side than on his. “Well, what have you got to say to me?” “It’s all passed safe through the melting-pot,” replied Fagin, “and this is your share. It’s rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but as I know you’ll do me a good turn another time, and—” “Stow that gammon,” interposed the robber, impatiently. “Where is it? Hand over!” “Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,” replied the Jew, soothingly. “Here it is!

It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn. Possibly, if he had observed the brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no good to him. “Is anybody here, Barney?” inquired Fagin; speaking, now that Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground. “Dot a shoul,” replied Barney; whose words: whether they came from the heart or not: made their way through the nose. “Nobody?” inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise: which perhaps might mean that Barney was at liberty
