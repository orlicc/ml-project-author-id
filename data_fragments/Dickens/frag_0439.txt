dilated; and his face grown livid with passion; but now, he shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy. After a short silence, he ventured to look round at his companion. He appeared somewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her. “Nancy, dear!” croaked the Jew, in his usual voice. “Did you mind me, dear?” “Don’t worry me now, Fagin!” replied the girl, raising her head languidly. “If Bill has not done it this time, he will another.
