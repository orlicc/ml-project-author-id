the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway. Having remained silent here, just long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth. “What’s the matter?” inquired the Dodger. “Ha! ha! ha!” roared Charley Bates. “Hold your noise,” remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round. “Do you want to be grabbed, stupid?” “I can’t help it,” said Charley, “I can’t help it!
