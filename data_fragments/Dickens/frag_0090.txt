to occupy it all, if you think proper.’ ‘Don’t go to the North Pole, ma’am!’ said Mr. Bounderby. ‘Thank you, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, and returned, though short of her former position. Mr. Bounderby sat looking at her, as, with the points of a stiff, sharp pair of scissors, she picked out holes for some inscrutable ornamental purpose, in a piece of cambric.
