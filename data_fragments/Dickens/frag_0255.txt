himself a crust of bread, and threw the knife down with a noise. Mrs. Sparsit took her foot out of her stirrup, and said, ‘Mr. Bounderby, sir!’ ‘Well, ma’am?’ retorted Mr. Bounderby. ‘What are you staring at?’ ‘May I ask, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, ‘have you been ruffled this morning?’ ‘Yes, ma’am.’ ‘May I inquire, sir,’ pursued the injured woman, ‘whether _I_ am the unfortunate cause of your having lost your temper?’ ‘Now, I’ll tell you what, ma’am,’ said Bounderby, ‘I am not come here to be bullied. A female may be highly connected, but she can’t be permitted to bother and badger a man in my position, and I am not going to put up with it.’ (Mr. Bounderby felt it necessary to get on: foreseeing that if he allowed of details, he would be beaten.)

Pray, sir,’ Mrs. Sparsit interposed, with sprightly cheerfulness, ‘don’t disparage your judgment. Everybody knows how unerring Mr. Bounderby’s judgment is. Everybody has had proofs of it. It must be the theme of general conversation. Disparage anything in yourself but your judgment, sir,’ said Mrs. Sparsit, laughing. Mr. Bounderby, very red and uncomfortable, resumed: ‘It appears to me, ma’am, I say, that a different sort of establishment altogether would bring out a lady of _your_ powers.
