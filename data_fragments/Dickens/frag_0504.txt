was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard Oliver’s history from his mother, understood it at once. “What direction did he take?” he asked, catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner. “That,” replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; “I missed them in an instant.” “Then, they are in the ditch!” said Harry. “Follow! And keep as near me, as you can.” So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him.

I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.” “Who was
