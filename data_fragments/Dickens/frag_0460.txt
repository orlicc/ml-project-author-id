Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?” asked the old lady, after a pause. “An hour and twelve minutes, ma’am,” replied Mr. Giles, referring to a silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon. “He is always slow,” remarked the old lady. “Brittles always was a slow boy, ma’am,” replied the attendant.
