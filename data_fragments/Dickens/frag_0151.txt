so proved it to be a failing of mine, Tom?’ said Louisa, showing no other sense of his discontent and ill-nature. ‘You know whether the cap fits you, Loo,’ returned her brother sulkily. ‘If it does, you can wear it.’ ‘Tom is misanthropical to-day, as all bored people are now and then,’ said Mr. Harthouse. ‘Don’t believe him, Mrs. Bounderby.
