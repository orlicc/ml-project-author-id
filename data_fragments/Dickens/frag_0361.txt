Strike me blind, if I don’t honour that ’ere girl, for her native talents.” “She’s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,” replied Barney. “Send her here,” said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. “Send her here.” Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete. “You are on the scent, are you, Nancy?” inquired Sikes, proffering the glass. “Yes, I am, Bill,” replied the young lady, disposing of its contents; “and tired enough of it I am, too.
