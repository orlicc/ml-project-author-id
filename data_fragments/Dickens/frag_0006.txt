and had a husband—with representations of flowers, would you?’ said the gentleman. ‘Why would you?’ ‘If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers,’ returned the girl. ‘And is that why you would put tables and chairs upon them, and have people walking over them with heavy boots?’ ‘It wouldn’t hurt them, sir.
