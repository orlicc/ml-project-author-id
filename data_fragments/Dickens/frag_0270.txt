You know you’re an orphan, I suppose?” “What’s that, sir?” inquired poor Oliver. “The boy _is_ a fool—I thought he was,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. “Hush!” said the gentleman who had spoken first. “You know you’ve got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don’t you?” “Yes, sir,” replied Oliver, weeping bitterly. “What are you crying for?” inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
