sell it for a great deal in the market.” “When could I see him?” asked Noah doubtfully. “Tomorrow morning.” “Where?” “Here.” “Um!” said Noah. “What’s the wages?” “Live like a gentleman—board and lodging, pipes and spirits free—half of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,” replied Mr. Fagin.
