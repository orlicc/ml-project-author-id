don’t suit me, that don’t; and so I tell yer.” “That’s not the smallest danger in it—not the very smallest,” said the Jew; “it’s only to dodge a woman.” “An old woman?” demanded Mr. Bolter. “A young one,” replied Fagin. “I can do that pretty well, I know,” said Bolter. “I was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school.
