is the lady of the house,” said Mr. Losberne, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie. Mr. Blathers made a bow. Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same. The latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society, or quite so much at his ease in it—one of the two—seated himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and the head of his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment. “Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,” said Blathers. “What are the circumstances?” Mr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at great length, and with much circumlocution.
