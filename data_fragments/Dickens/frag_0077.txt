me. Between them, and a working woman fu’ of faults, there is a deep gulf set. My little sister is among them, but she is changed.’ She raised her eyes for a moment as she said the words; and then they fell again, in all their gentleness and mildness, on his face. ‘Thou changest me from bad to good.
