over!” Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and resumed: “Do you know where this poor boy is now?” “No more than nobody,” replied Mr. Bumble. “Well, what _do_ you know of him?” inquired the old gentleman. “Speak out, my friend, if you have anything to say. What _do_ you know of him?” “You don’t happen to know any good of him, do you?” said Mr. Grimwig, caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble’s features. Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with portentous solemnity. “You see?” said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow.

It was too late to do it now, however; so he shook his head gravely, and, pocketing the five guineas, withdrew. Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so much disturbed by the beadle’s tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore
