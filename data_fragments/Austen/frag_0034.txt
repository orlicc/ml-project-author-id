her manner of answering me? How completely it meant, ‘why should my picture be drawn?’” “Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.” Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work directly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet.
