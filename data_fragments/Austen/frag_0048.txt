a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.” “Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is so; but I hope you are mistaken.” “I saw her answer!—nothing could be clearer.” “You saw her answer!—you wrote her answer too.

But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well.
