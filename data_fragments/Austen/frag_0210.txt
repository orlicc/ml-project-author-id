He sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing himself, it was only to say, “Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.” “But you will come again,” said Emma. “This will not be your only visit to Randalls.” “Ah!—(shaking his head)—the uncertainty of when I may be able to return!—I shall try for it with a zeal!—It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares!—and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring—but I am afraid—they did not stir last spring—I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever.” “Our poor ball must be quite given up.” “Ah! that ball!—why did we wait for any thing?—why not seize the pleasure at once?—How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation!—You told us it would be so.—Oh!
