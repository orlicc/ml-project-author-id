had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs. “That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?” “The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.” “I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?” “She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.” “Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than many girls.
