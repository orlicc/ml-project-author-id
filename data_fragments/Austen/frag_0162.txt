any body, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her.” “May I, indeed?—Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set. Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly, warm-hearted woman. I like them all.” “You know Miss Fairfax’s situation in life, I conclude; what she is destined to be?” “Yes—(rather hesitatingly)—I believe I do.” “You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,” said Mrs. Weston smiling; “remember that I am here.—Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax’s situation in life.

That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.” “Proof indeed!” said Emma, highly amused.—“Mr. Dixon is very musical, is he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.” “Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell
