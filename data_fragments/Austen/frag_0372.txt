ever was. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.” “Your parish there was small,” said Jane. “Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject talked of.” “But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge; the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.” “Ah! you clever creature, that’s very true.
