told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use to any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.” “Come, come,” cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, “I must beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;—I who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you.” “Oh! good Mr. Perry—how is he, sir?” “Why, pretty well; but not quite well.
