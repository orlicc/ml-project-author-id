proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete. “He has been wanting to come to us,” continued Mr. Weston, “ever since September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his own time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices. But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January.” “What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as yourself.” “Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.

If you think he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.” “Yes—I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at the place in my life.—She is an odd woman!—But I
