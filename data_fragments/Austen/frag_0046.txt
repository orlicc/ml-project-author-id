of her disposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman.” “I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting.” “Come,” said he, “you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you that you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl’s giggle; she really does you credit.” “Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may. _You_ do not often overpower me with it.” “You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?” “Almost every moment.

He is desperately in love and means to marry her.” “He is very obliging,” said Emma; “but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him?” “Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe, considers me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him
