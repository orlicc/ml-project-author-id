presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as settled.” “Excuse me,” said Jane earnestly, “I cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am not here, by my grandmama’s.” “Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!—And it is a kindness to employ our men.” Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley. “The post-office is a wonderful establishment!” said she.—“The regularity and despatch of it!
