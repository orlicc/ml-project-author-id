was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?” “Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane!

It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his
