true crocodile in South America. The distinction between them----" "I meant that I could see nothing unusual--nothing to justify what you have said." He smiled serenely. "Try the next page," said he. I was still unable to sympathize. It was a full-page sketch of a landscape roughly tinted in color--the kind of painting which an open-air artist takes as a guide to a future more elaborate effort. There was a pale-green foreground of feathery vegetation, which sloped upwards and ended in a line of cliffs dark red in color, and curiously ribbed like some basaltic formations which I have seen. They extended in an unbroken wall right across the background. At one point was an isolated pyramidal rock, crowned by a great tree, which appeared to be separated by a cleft from the main crag. Behind it all, a blue tropical sky. A thin green line of vegetation fringed the summit of the ruddy cliff. "Well?" he asked.

No one on earth has ever dreamed of such a possibility. Now the next." I turned it over, and gave an exclamation of surprise.

"The obvious one that the creature exists. That is actually sketched from the life." I should have laughed only that I had a vision of our doing another Catharine-wheel down the passage. "No doubt," said I, "no doubt," as one humors an imbecile. "I confess, however," I
