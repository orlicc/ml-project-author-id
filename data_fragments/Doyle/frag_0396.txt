They carried off their wounded comrade--he was bleedin' like a pig--and then they sat around us, and if ever I saw frozen murder it was in their faces. They were big fellows, as big as a man and a deal stronger. Curious glassy gray eyes they have, under red tufts, and they just sat and gloated and gloated. Challenger is no chicken, but even he was cowed. He managed to struggle to his feet, and yelled out at them to have done with it and get it over.

They wouldn't touch the guns and things--thought them dangerous, I expect--but they carried away all our loose food.
