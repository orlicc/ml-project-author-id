didn’t. There, now!” “Well, then, I b’lieve you. But answer me only jest this one more—now _don’t_ git mad; didn’t you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it?” The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says: “Well, I don’t care if I _did_, I didn’t _do_ it, anyway. But you not only had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.” “I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that’s honest. I won’t say I warn’t _goin_’ to do it, because I _was;_ but you—I mean somebody—got in ahead o’ me.” “It’s a lie! You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or—” The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out: “’Nough!—_I own up!_” I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off and says: “If you ever deny it again I’ll drown you. It’s _well_ for you to set there and blubber like a baby—it’s fitten for you, after the way you’ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything—and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for ’em. It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_ that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit—you wanted to get what money I’d got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it _all!_” The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling: “Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn’t me.” “Dry up! I don’t want to hear no more _out_ of you!” says the duke. “And _now_ you see what you _got_ by it. They’ve got all their own money back, and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_. G’long to bed, and don’t you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long ’s _you_ live!” So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort, and before long the duke tackled _his_ bottle; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got, the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other’s arms. They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn’t get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything. CHAPTER XXXI. We dasn’t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they begun to work the villages again. First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn’t make enough for them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a dancing-school; but they didn’t know
