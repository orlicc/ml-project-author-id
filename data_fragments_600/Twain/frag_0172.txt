mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along. I’ll go and stuff the straw into Jim’s clothes to represent his mother in disguise, and be ready to _ba_ like a sheep and shove soon as you get there.” So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a person’s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says: “You been down cellar?” “Yes’m.” “What you been doing down there?” “Noth’n.” “_Noth’n!_” “No’m.” “Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?” “I don’t know ’m.” “You don’t _know?_ Don’t answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what you been _doing_ down there.” “I hain’t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I have.” I reckoned she’d let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I s’pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warn’t yard-stick straight; so she says, very decided: “You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come.

I warn’t easy myself, but I didn’t take my hat off, all the same. I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we’d overdone this thing, and what a thundering hornet’s-nest we’d got ourselves into, so we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us.
