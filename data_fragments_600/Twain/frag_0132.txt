was all took by surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and whispers, ‘Heel it now, or they’ll hang ye, sure!’ and I lit out. It didn’t seem no good for _me_ to stay—_I_ couldn’t do nothing, and I didn’t want to be hung if I could get away. So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or they’d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn’t alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn’t.” Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, “Oh, yes, it’s _mighty_ likely!” and shook me up again, and said he reckoned he’d drownd me. But the duke says: “Leggo the boy, you old idiot! Would _you_ a done any different? Did you inquire around for _him_ when you got loose? _I_ don’t remember it.” So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it. But the duke says: “You better a blame sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you’re the one that’s entitled to it most. You hain’t done a thing from the start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark. That _was_ bright—it was right down bully; and it was the thing that saved us. For if it hadn’t been for that, they’d a jailed us till them Englishmen’s baggage come—and then—the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took ’em to the graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the excited fools hadn’t let go all holts and made that rush to get a look, we’d a slept in our cravats to-night—cravats warranted to _wear_, too—longer than _we’d_ need ’em.” They was still a minute—thinking; then the king says, kind of absent-minded like: “Mf! And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!” That made me squirm! “Yes,” says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, “_We_ did.” After about a half a minute the king drawls out: “Leastways, _I_ did.” The duke says, the same way: “On the contrary, _I_ did.” The king kind of ruffles up, and says: “Looky here, Bilgewater, what’r you referrin’ to?” The duke says, pretty brisk: “When it comes to that, maybe you’ll let me ask, what was _you_ referring to?” “Shucks!” says the king, very sarcastic; “but _I_ don’t know—maybe you was asleep, and didn’t know what you was about.” The duke bristles up now, and says: “Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame’ fool? Don’t you reckon _I_ know who hid that money in that coffin?” “_Yes_, sir! I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!” “It’s a lie!”—and the duke went for him. The king sings out: “Take y’r hands off!—leggo my throat!—I take it all back!” The duke says: “Well, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there, intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig it up, and have it all to yourself.” “Wait jest a minute, duke—answer me this one question, honest and fair; if you didn’t put the money there, say it, and I’ll b’lieve you, and take back everything I said.” “You old scoundrel, I didn’t, and you know I
