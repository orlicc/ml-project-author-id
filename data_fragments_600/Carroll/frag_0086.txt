+ y'm_{1} (which > x'y'_{1}).] The Formula, to be remembered, is, xm_{0} + ym_{1} > x'y_{1} with the following Rule:-- _A Nullity and an Entity, with Like Eliminands, yield an Entity, in which the Nullity-Retinend changes its Sign._ [Note that this Rule is merely the Formula expressed in words.] pg077 Fig. III. This includes any Pair of Premisses which are both of them Nullities, and which contain Like Eliminands asserted to exist. The simplest case is xm_{0} + ym_{0} + m_{1} [Note that "m_{1}" is here stated _separately_, because it does not matter in which of the two Premisses it occurs: so that this includes the _three_ forms "m_{1}x_{0} + ym_{0}", "xm_{0} + m_{1}y_{0}", and "m_{1}x_{0} + m_{1}y_{0}".] .---------------. .-------. | | | | | | | .---|---. | |---|---| | |(O)|(O)| | | |(I)| |---|---|---|---| .-------. | |(O)|(I)| | | .---|---. | .'. x'y'_{1} | | | .---------------. In this case we see that the Conclusion is an Entity, and that _both_ Retinends have changed their Signs. And we should find this Rule to hold good with _any_ Pair of Premisses which fulfil the given conditions. [The Reader had better satisfy himself of this, by working out, on Diagrams, several varieties, such as x'm_{0} + m_{1}y_{0} (which > xy'_{1}) m'_{1}x_{0} + m'y'_{0} (which > x'y_{1}) m_{1}x'_{0} + m_{1}y'_{0} (which > xy_{1}).] The Formula, to be remembered, is xm_{0} + ym_{0} + m_{1} > x'y'_{1} with the following Rule (which is merely the Formula expressed in words):-- _Two Nullities, with Like Eliminands asserted to exist, yield an Entity, in which both Retinends change their Signs._ * * * * * In order to help the Reader to remember the peculiarities and Formulae of these three Figures, I will put them all together in one Table. pg078 TABLE IX. _______________________________________________________ | | | Fig. I. | | | | xm_{0} + ym'_{0} > xy_{0} | | | | Two Nullities, with Unlike Eliminands, yield a | | Nullity, in which both Retinends keep their Signs. | | | | A Retinend, asserted in the Premisses to exist, may | | be so asserted in the Conclusion. | |_______________________________________________________| | | | Fig. II. | | | | xm_{0} + ym_{1} > x'y_{1} | | | | A Nullity and an Entity, with Like Eliminands, | | yield an Entity, in which the Nullity-Retinend | | changes its Sign. | |_______________________________________________________| | | | Fig. III. | | | | xm_{0} + ym_{0} + m_{1} > x'y'_{1} | | | | Two Nullities, with Like Eliminands asserted | | to exist, yield an Entity, in which both Retinends | | change their Signs. | |_______________________________________________________| I will now work out, by these Formulae, as models for the Reader to imitate, some Problems in Syllogisms which have been already worked, by Diagrams, in Book V., Chap.
