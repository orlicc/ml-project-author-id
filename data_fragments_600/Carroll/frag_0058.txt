which the two Terms are Specieses, is called the '=Universe of Discourse=,' or (more briefly) the '=Univ.=' The Sign of Quantity is "Some" or "No" or "All". [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_ Members of its Subject are _also_ Members of its Predicate, it does not tell us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with _three_ numbers, which are, in ascending order, "0", "1 or more", "the total number of Members of the Subject".] It is called "a Proposition of Relation" because its effect is to assert that a certain _relationship_ exists between its Terms. pg013 Sec. 2. _Reduction of a Proposition of Relation to Normal form._ The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:-- (1) Ascertain what is the _Subject_ (i.e., ascertain what Class we are _talking about_); (2) If the verb, governed by the Subject, is _not_ the verb "are" (or "is"), substitute for it a phrase beginning with "are" (or "is"); (3) Ascertain what is the _Predicate_ (i.e., ascertain what Class it is, which is asserted to contain _some_, or _none_, or _all_, of the Members of the Subject); (4) If the Name of each Term is _completely expressed_ (i.e. if it contains a Substantive), there is no need to determine the 'Univ.'; but, if either Name is _incompletely expressed_, and contains _Attributes_ only, it is then necessary to determine a 'Univ.', in order to insert its Name as the Substantive. (5) Ascertain the _Sign of Quantity_; (6) Arrange in the following order:-- Sign of Quantity, Subject, Copula, Predicate. [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules. (1) "Some apples are not ripe." (1) The Subject is "apples." (2) The Verb is "are." (3) The Predicate is "not-ripe * * *." (As no Substantive is expressed, and we have not yet settled what the Univ. is to be, we are forced to leave a blank.) (4) Let Univ. be "fruit." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "some." (6) The Proposition now becomes "Some | apples | are | not-ripe fruit." pg014 (2) "None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent." (1) The Subject is "my speculations." (2) The Verb is "have brought," for which we substitute the phrase "are * * * that have brought". (3) The Predicate is "* * * that have brought &c." (4) Let Univ. be "transactions." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "none of." (6) The Proposition now becomes "None of | my speculations | are | transactions that have brought me as much as 5 per cent." (3) "None but the brave deserve the fair." To begin with, we note that the phrase "none but the brave" is equivalent to "no _not_-brave." (1) The Subject has for its _Attribute_ "not-brave." But no _Substantive_ is supplied. So we express the Subject as "not-brave * * *." (2) The Verb is "deserve," for which we substitute the phrase "are deserving of". (3) The Predicate is "* * * deserving of the fair." (4) Let Univ. be "persons." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "no." (6) The Proposition now becomes "No | not-brave persons | are | persons deserving of the fair." (4) "A lame puppy would not say "thank you" if you offered to lend it a skipping-rope." (1) The Subject is evidently "lame puppies," and all the rest of the sentence must somehow be packed into the Predicate. (2) The Verb is "would not say," &c., for which we may substitute the phrase "are not grateful for." (3) The Predicate may be expressed as "* * * not
