(3) "No x' are m'; All m are y". Here we begin by breaking up the Second into the two Propositions to which it is equivalent. Thus we have _three_ Propositions to represent, viz.-- (1) "No x' are m'; (2) Some m are y; (3) No m are y'". These we will take in the order 1, 3, 2. First we take No. (1), viz. "No x' are m'". This gives us Diagram a. pg052 Adding to this, No. (3), viz. "No m are y'", we get Diagram b. This time the "I", representing No. (2), viz. "Some m are y," has to sit on the fence, as there is no "O" to order it off!

(4) "All m are x; All y are m". Here we break up _both_ Propositions, and thus get _four_ to represent, viz.-- (1) "Some m are x; (2) No m are x'; (3) Some y are m; (4) No y are m'". These we will take in the order 2, 4, 1, 3. First we take No. (2), viz. "No m are x'". This gives us Diagram a. To this we add No. (4), viz. "No y are m'", and thus get Diagram b. If we were to add to this No. (1), viz. "Some m are x", we should have to put the "I" on a fence: so let us try No. (3) instead, viz. "Some y are m". This gives us Diagram c. And now there is no need to trouble about No. (1), as it would not add anything to our information to put a "I" on the fence. The Diagram _already_ tells us that "Some m are x".] a b c .---------------. .---------------. .---------------. | | | |(O) | | |(O) | | | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | | | | | | | | | | | |(I)| | | |---|---|---|---| |---|---|---|---| |---|---|---|---| | |(O)|(O)| | | |(O)|(O)| | | |(O)|(O)| | | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | .---|---. | | | | |(O) | | |(O) | | .---------------. .---------------. .---------------.

The best plan, for a _beginner_, is to draw a _Biliteral_ Diagram alongside of it, and to transfer, from the one to the other, all the information he can. He can then read off, from the Biliteral Diagram, the required Propositions. After a little practice, he will be able
