Sec. 2. _Representation of Propositions of Relation in terms of x and m, or of y and m._ Let us take, first, the Pair of Converse Propositions "Some x are m" = "Some m are x." We know that each of these is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence "Some xm exist", which we already know how to represent. .---------------. | | | | .---|---. | | | (.) | | |---|---|---|---| | | | | | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------.

We know (see p. 18) that this is a _Double_ Proposition, and equivalent to the _two_ Propositions "Some x are m" and "No x are m' ", each of which we already know how to represent. Similarly for the fifteen similar Propositions, in terms of x and m, or of y and m. These thirty-two Propositions of Relation are the only ones that we shall have to represent on this Diagram. The Reader should now get his genial friend to question him on the following four Tables. The Victim should have nothing before him but a blank Triliteral Diagram, a Red Counter, and 2 Grey ones, with which he is to represent the various Propositions named by the Inquisitor, _e.g._ "No y' are m", "Some xm' exist", &c., &c. pg046 TABLE V. .---------------------------------------------------------. | .---------------.
