or h'. Looking along the row, we fix on No. 2, and tack it on. Now these 3 Nullities are really equivalent to (l'h + dh'), in which h and h' must be eliminated, and what remains taken as one expression. So we _underscore_ them. The result reads as l'd. We now want a Premiss containing l or d'. No. 6 will do. These 4 Nullities are really equivalent to (l'd + b'l). So we underscore l' and l. The result reads as db'. We now want a Premiss containing d' or b. No. 4 will do. Here we underscore b' and b. The result reads as de'. We now want a Premiss containing d' or e. No. 7 will do. Here we underscore d and d'. The result reads as c'e'. We now want a Premiss containing c or e. No. 3 will do--in fact _must_ do, as it is the only one left. Here we underscore c' and c; and, as the whole thing now reads as e'a, we tack on e'a_{0} as the _Conclusion_, with a >. We now look along the row of Data, to see whether e' or a has been given as _existent_. We find that a has been so given in No. 3. So we add this fact to the Conclusion, which now stands as > e'a_{0} + a_{1}, _i.e._ > a_{1}e'_{0}; i.e. "All a are e." If the Reader has faithfully obeyed the above directions, his written solution will now stand as follows:-- 1 2 3 4 k_{1}l'_{0} + dh'_{0} + a_{1}c_{0} + b_{1}e'_{0} + 5 6 7 k'h_{0} + b'l_{0} + d'_{1}c'_{0} 1 5 2 6 4 7 3 kl' + k'h + dh' + b'l + be' + d'c' + ac -- = - -= - = = = - = > e'a_{0} + a_{1} _i.e._ > a_{1}e'_{0}; _i.e._ "All a are e." pg093 The Reader should now take a second piece of paper, and copy the Data only, and try to work out the solution for himself, beginning with some other Premiss. If he fails to bring out the Conclusion a_{1}e'_{0}, I would advise him to take a third piece of paper, and _begin again_!] I will now work out, in its briefest form, a Sorites of 5 Premisses, to serve as a model for the Reader to imitate in working examples. (1) "I greatly value everything that John gives me; (2) Nothing but this bone will satisfy my dog; (3) I take particular care of everything that I greatly value; (4) This bone was a present from John; (5) The things, of which I take particular care, are things I do _not_ give to my dog". Univ. "things"; a = given by John to me; b = given by me to my dog; c = greatly valued by me; d = satisfactory to my dog; e = taken particular care of by me; h = this bone. 1 2 3 4 5 a_{1}c'_{0} + h'd_{0} + c_{1}e'_{0} + h_{1}a'_{0} + e_{1}b_{0} 1 3 4 2 5 ac' + ce' + ha' + h'd + eb > db_{0} -- =- -= = = i.e. "Nothing, that I give my dog, satisfies him," or, "My dog is not satisfied with _anything_ that I give him!" [Note that, in working a Sorites by this process, we may begin with _any_ Premiss we choose. For instance, we might begin with No. 5, and the result would then be 5 3 1 4 2 eb + ce' + ac' + ha' + h'd > bd_{0}] - -= -= -= = [Work Examples Sec.
