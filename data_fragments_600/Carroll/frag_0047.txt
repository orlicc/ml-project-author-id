found in that mythical island, whose inhabitants "earned a precarious living by taking in each others' washing"! By simply translating "telling 2 Truths" into "taking _both_ of 2 condiments (salt and mustard)," "telling 2 Lies" into "taking _neither_ of them" and "telling a Truth and a Lie (order not specified)" into "taking only _one_ condiment (it is not specified _which_)," I have escaped all those metaphysical puzzles, and have produced a Problem which, when translated into a Set of symbolized Premisses, furnishes the very same _Data_ as were furnished by the Problem of the "Five Liars." pg-x The coined words, introduced in previous editions, such as "Eliminands" and "Retinends", perhaps hardly need any apology: they were indispensable to my system: but the new plural, here used for the first time, viz. "Soriteses", will, I fear, be condemned as "bad English", unless I say a word in its defence. We have _three_ singular nouns, in English, of plural _form_, "series", "species", and "Sorites": in all three, the awkwardness, of using the same word for both singular and plural, must often have been felt: this has been remedied, in the case of "series" by coining the plural "serieses", which has already found its way into the dictionaries: so I am no rash innovator, but am merely "following suit", in using the new plural "Soriteses". In conclusion, let me point out that even those, who are obliged to study _Formal_ Logic, with a view to being able to answer Examination-Papers in that subject, will find the study of _Symbolic_ Logic most helpful for this purpose, in throwing light upon many of the obscurities with which Formal Logic abounds, and in furnishing a delightfully easy method of _testing_ the results arrived at by the cumbrous processes which Formal Logic enforces upon its votaries. This is, I believe, the very first attempt (with the exception of my own little book, _The Game of Logic_, published in 1886, a very incomplete performance) that has been made to _popularise_ this fascinating subject. It has cost me _years_ of hard work: but if it should prove, as I hope it may, to be of _real_ service to the young, and to be taken up, in High Schools and in private families, as a valuable addition to their stock of healthful mental recreations, such a result would more than repay ten times the labour that I have expended on it. L. C. 29, BEDFORD STREET, STRAND. _Christmas, 1896._ pg-xi INTRODUCTION. _TO LEARNERS._ [N.B. Some remarks, addressed to _Teachers_, will be found in the Appendix, at p. 165.] The Learner, who wishes to try the question _fairly_, whether this little book does, or does not, supply the materials for a most interesting mental recreation, is _earnestly_ advised to adopt the following Rules:-- (1) Begin at the _beginning_, and do not allow yourself to gratify a mere idle curiosity by dipping into the book, here and there. This would very likely lead to your throwing it aside, with the remark "This is _much_ too hard for me!", and thus losing the chance of adding a very _large_ item to your stock of mental delights. This Rule (of not _dipping_) is very _desirable_ with _other_ kinds of books----such as novels, for instance, where you may easily spoil much of the enjoyment you would otherwise get from the story, by dipping into it further on, so that what the author meant to be a pleasant surprise comes to you as a matter of course. Some people, I know, make a practice of looking into Vol. III first, just to see how the story
