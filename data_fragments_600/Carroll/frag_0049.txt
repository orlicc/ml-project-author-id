have nothing real to _show_ for it, as a _result!_ You enjoyed the Game, and the victory, no doubt, _at the time_: but you have no _result_ that you can treasure up and get real _good_ out of. And, all the while, you have been leaving unexplored a perfect _mine_ of wealth. Once master the machinery of Symbolic Logic, and you have a mental occupation always at hand, of absorbing interest, and one that will be of real _use_ to you in _any_ subject you may take up. It will give you clearness of thought----the ability to _see your way_ through a puzzle----the habit of arranging your ideas in an orderly and get-at-able form----and, more valuable than all, the power to detect _fallacies_, and to tear to pieces the flimsy illogical arguments, which you will so continually encounter in books, in newspapers, in speeches, and even in sermons, and which so easily delude those who have never taken the trouble to master this fascinating Art. _Try it._ That is all I ask of you!
