Name is called a '=Definition=' of any Member of that Species, and to give it such a Name is to '=define=' it. [Thus, we may define a "Treasure" as a "valuable Thing." In this case we regard "Things" as the _Genus_, and "valuable" as the _Differentia_.] The following Examples, of this Process, may be taken as models for working others. [Note that, in each Definition, the Substantive, representing a Member (or Members) of the _Genus_, is printed in Capitals.] 1. Define "a Treasure." _Ans._ "a valuable THING." 2. Define "Treasures." _Ans._ "valuable THINGS." 3. Define "a Town." _Ans._ "a material artificial THING, consisting of houses and streets." pg007 4. Define "Men." _Ans._ "material, living THINGS, belonging to the Animal Kingdom, having two hands and two feet"; or else "ANIMALS having two hands and two feet." 5. Define "London." _Ans._ "the material artificial THING, which consists of houses and streets, and has four million inhabitants"; or else "the TOWN which has four million inhabitants." [Note that we here use the article "the" instead of "a", because we happen to know that there is only _one_ such Thing. The Reader can set himself any number of Examples of this Process, by simply choosing the Name of any common Thing (such as "house," "tree," "knife"), making a Definition for it, and then testing his answer by referring to any English Dictionary.] pg008 BOOK II. PROPOSITIONS. CHAPTER I. _PROPOSITIONS GENERALLY._ Sec. 1. _Introductory._ Note that the word "some" is to be regarded, henceforward, as meaning "one or more." The word 'Proposition,' as used in ordinary conversation, may be applied to _any_ word, or phrase, which conveys any information whatever. [Thus the words "yes" and "no" are Propositions in the ordinary sense of the word; and so are the phrases "you owe me five farthings" and "I don't!" Such words as "oh!" or "never!", and such phrases as "fetch me that book!" "which book do you mean?" do not seem, at first sight, to convey any _information_; but they can easily be turned into equivalent forms which do so, viz. "I am surprised," "I will never consent to it," "I order you to fetch me that book," "I want to know which book you mean."] But a '=Proposition=,' as used in this First Part of "Symbolic Logic," has a peculiar form, which may be called its '=Normal form='; and if any Proposition, which we wish to use in an argument, is not in normal form, we must reduce it to such a form, before we can use it. pg009 A '=Proposition=,' when in normal form, asserts, as to certain two Classes, which are called its '=Subject=' and '=Predicate=,' either (1) that _some_ Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate; or (2) that _no_ Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate; or (3) that _all_ Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate. The Subject and the Predicate of a Proposition are called its '=Terms=.' Two Propositions, which convey the _same_ information, are said to be '=equivalent='. [Thus, the two Propositions, "I see John" and "John is seen by me," are equivalent.] Sec. 2. _Normal form of a Proposition._ A Proposition, in normal form, consists of four parts, viz.-- (1) The word "some," or "no," or "all." (This word, which tells us _how many_ Members of the Subject are also Members of the Predicate, is called the '=Sign of Quantity=.') (2) Name of Subject. (3) The verb "are" (or "is"). (This is called the '=Copula=.') (4) Name of Predicate. pg010 Sec. 3. _Various kinds of Propositions._ A Proposition, that begins with
