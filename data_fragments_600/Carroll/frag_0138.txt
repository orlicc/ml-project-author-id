the larger of the two? For the purposes of Symbolic Logic, it is so _much_ the most convenient plan to regard the two sub-divisions, produced by Dichotomy, on the _same_ footing, and to say, of any Thing, either that it "is" in the one, or that it "is" in the other, that I do not think any Reader of this book is likely to demur to my adopting that course. pg173 Sec. 4. _The theory that "two Negative Premisses prove nothing"._ This I consider to be _another_ craze of "The Logicians", fully as morbid as their dread of a negative Attribute. It is, perhaps, best refuted by the method of _Instantia Contraria_. Take the following Pairs of Premisses:-- "None of my boys are conceited; None of my girls are greedy". "None of my boys are clever; None but a clever boy could solve this problem". "None of my boys are learned; Some of my boys are not choristers". (This last Proposition is, in _my_ system, an _affirmative_ one, since I should read it "are not-choristers"; but, in dealing with "The Logicians," I may fairly treat it as a _negative_ one, since _they_ would read it "are-not choristers".) If you, dear Reader, declare, after full consideration of these Pairs of Premisses, that you cannot deduce a Conclusion from _any_ of them----why, all I can say is that, like the Duke in Patience, you "will have to be contented with our heart-felt sympathy"! [See Note (C), p. 196.] Sec. 5. _Euler's Method of Diagrams._ Diagrams seem to have been used, at first, to represent _Propositions_ only. In Euler's well-known Circles, each was supposed to contain a class, and the Diagram consisted of two circles, which exhibited the relations, as to inclusion and exclusion, existing between the two Classes. _____ _/ ___ \_ / / y \ \ | \___/ | \_ x _/ \_____/ Thus, the Diagram, here given, exhibits the two Classes, whose respective Attributes are x and y, as so related to each other that the following Propositions are all simultaneously true:--"All x are y", "No x are not-y", "Some x are y", "Some y are not-x", "Some not-y are not-x", and, of course, the Converses of the last four. pg174 _____ _/ ___ \_ / / y \ \ | \___/ | \_ x _/ \_____/ Similarly, with this Diagram, the following Propositions are true:--"All y are x", "No y are not-x", "Some y are x", "Some x are not-y", "Some not-x are not-y", and, of course, the Converses of the last four. _____ _____ _/ \_ _/ \_ / \ / \ | x | | y | \_ _/ \_ _/ \_____/ \_____/ Similarly, with this Diagram, the following are true:--"All x are not-y", "All y are not-x", "No x are y", "Some x are not-y", "Some y are not-x", "Some not-x are not-y", and the Converses of the last four. _____ _____ _/ \_/ \_ / / \ \ | x | | y | \_ \_/ _/ \_____/ \_____/ Similarly, with this Diagram, the following are true:--"Some x are y", "Some x are not-y", "Some not-x are y", "Some not-x are not-y", and of course, their four Converses. Note that _all_ Euler's Diagrams assert "Some not-x are not-y." Apparently it never occured to him that it might _sometimes_ fail to be true! Now, to represent "All x are y", the _first_ of these Diagrams would suffice. Similarly, to represent "No x are y", the _third_ would suffice. But to represent any _Particular_ Proposition, at least _three_ Diagrams would be needed (in order to include all
