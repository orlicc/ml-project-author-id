which, being Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. that _some existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once. Hence it is to be understood as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is _Real_. [Thus, the Proposition "Some rich men are invalids" is to be understood as asserting that _some existing Things_ are "rich invalids". Hence it implies that _each_ of the two Classes, "rich men" and "invalids", taken by itself, is _Real_.] A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "No", is henceforward to be understood as asserting that there are _no existing Things_ which, being Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. that _no existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once. But this implies nothing as to the _Reality_ of either Term taken by itself. [Thus, the Proposition "No mermaids are milliners" is to be understood as asserting that _no existing Things_ are "mermaid-milliners". But this implies nothing as to the _Reality_, or the _Unreality_, of either of the two Classes, "mermaids" and "milliners", taken by itself. In this case as it happens, the Subject is _Imaginary_, and the Predicate _Real_.] A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", contains (see Sec. 3) a similar Proposition beginning with "Some". Hence it is to be understood as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is _Real_. [Thus, the Proposition "All hyaenas are savage animals" contains the Proposition "Some hyaenas are savage animals". Hence it implies that _each_ of the two Classes, "hyaenas" and "savage animals", taken by itself, is _Real_.] pg020 Sec. 5. _Translation of a Proposition of Relation into one or more Propositions of Existence._ We have seen that a Proposition of Relation, beginning with "Some," asserts that _some existing Things_, being Members of its Subject, are _also_ Members of its Predicate. Hence, it asserts that some existing Things are Members of _both_; i.e. it asserts that some existing Things are Members of the Class of Things which have _all_ the Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate. Hence, to translate it into a Proposition of Existence, we take "existing Things" as the new _Subject_, and Things, which have _all_ the Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate, as the new Predicate. Similarly for a Proposition of Relation beginning with "No". A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", is (as shown in Sec. 3) equivalent to _two_ Propositions, one beginning with "Some" and the other with "No", each of which we now know how to translate. [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules. (1) "Some apples are not ripe." Here we arrange thus:-- "Some" _Sign of Quantity_. "existing Things" _Subject_. "are" _Copula_. "not-ripe apples" _Predicate_. or thus:-- "Some | existing Things | are | not-ripe apples." pg021 (2) "Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be." Here we arrange thus:-- "Some | existing Things | are | farmers who always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be." (3) "No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars." Here we arrange thus:-- "No | existing Things |are | lambs accustomed to smoke cigars." (4) "None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent." Here we arrange thus:-- "No | existing Things | are | speculations of mine, which have brought me as much as 5 per cent." (5) "None but the brave deserve the fair." Here we note, to begin with, that the phrase "none but the brave" is equivalent to "no not-brave men." We then arrange thus:-- "No | existing Things | are | not-brave men deserving of the fair."
