into abstract form, as follows:-- "No x are m'; All m are y". pg061 Next, by the process described at p. 50, we represent these on a Triliteral Diagram, thus:-- .---------------. |(O) | (O)| | .---|---. | | | |(O)| | |---|(I)|---|---| | | |(O)| | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------. Next, by the process described at p. 53, we transfer to a Biliteral Diagram all the information we can. .-------. | |(O)| |---|---| | | | .-------. The result we read as "No x are y'" or as "No y' are x," whichever we prefer. So we refer to our Dictionary, to see which will look best; and we choose "No x are y'", which, translated into concrete form, is "No son of mine fails to be treated with respect". (2) "All cats understand French; Some chickens are cats". Taking "creatures" as Univ., we write these as follows:-- "All cats are creatures understanding French; Some chickens are cats". We can now construct our Dictionary, viz. m = cats; x = understanding French; y = chickens. The proposed Premisses, translated into abstract form, are "All m are x; Some y are m". In order to represent these on a Triliteral Diagram, we break up the first into the two Propositions to which it is equivalent, and thus get the _three_ Propositions (1) "Some m are x; (2) No m are x'; (3) Some y are m". The Rule, given at p. 50, would make us take these in the order 2, 1, 3. This, however, would produce the result .-----------------. | | | | .----|----. | | |(I)(I) | | | |----|----| | | |(O) | (O)| | | .----|----. | | | | .-----------------. pg062 So it would be better to take them in the order 2, 3, 1. Nos. (2) and (3) give us the result here shown; and now we need not trouble about No. (1), as the Proposition "Some m are x" is _already_ represented on the Diagram. .---------------. | | | | .---|---. | | |(I)| | | |---|---|---|---| | |(O)|(O)| | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------. Transferring our information to a Biliteral Diagram, we get .-------. |(I)| | |---|---| | | | .-------. This result we can read either as "Some x are y" or "Some y are x". After consulting our Dictionary, we choose "Some y are x", which, translated into concrete form, is "Some chickens understand French." (3) "All diligent students are successful; All ignorant students are unsuccessful". Let Univ. be "students"; m = successful; x = diligent; y = ignorant. These Premisses, in abstract form, are "All x are m; All y are m'". These, broken up, give us the four Propositions (1) "Some x are m; (2) No x are m'; (3) Some y are m'; (4) No y are m". which we will take in the order 2, 4, 1, 3. Representing these on a Triliteral Diagram, we get .---------------. |(O) | (O)| | .---|---. | | |(O)|(I)| | |---|---|---|---| | |(O)| | | | .---|---. | |(I) | | .---------------. And this information, transferred to a Biliteral Diagram, is .-------. |(O)|(I)| |---|---| |(I)| | .-------. Here we get _two_ Conclusions, viz. "All x are y'; All y are x'." pg063 And these, translated into concrete form, are "All diligent students are (not-ignorant, i.e.) learned; All ignorant students are (not-diligent, i.e.) idle". (See p. 4.) (4) "Of the prisoners who were put on their trial at the last Assizes, all, against whom the verdict 'guilty' was returned, were sentenced to imprisonment; Some, who were sentenced
