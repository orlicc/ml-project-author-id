"All selfish men are disobliging".

This party of tourists need not run." Univ. "persons meaning to go by the train, and unable to get a conveyance"; m = having enough time to walk to the station; x = needing to run; y = these tourists. pg069 .---------------.

[Here is _another_ opportunity, gentle Reader, for playing a trick on your innocent friend. Put the proposed Syllogism before him, and ask him what he thinks of the Conclusion. He will reply "Why, it's perfectly correct, of course! And if your precious Logic-book tells you it _isn't_, don't believe it! You don't mean to tell me those tourists _need_ to run? If _I_ were one of them, and knew the _Premisses_ to be true, I should be _quite_ clear that I _needn't_ run--and I _should walk!_" And _you_ will reply "But suppose there was a mad bull behind you?" And then your innocent friend will say "Hum! Ha! I must think that over a bit!" You may then explain to him, as a convenient _test_ of the soundness of a Syllogism, that, if circumstances can be invented which, without interfering with the truth of the _Premisses_, would make the _Conclusion_ false, the Syllogism _must_ be unsound.] [Review Tables V-VIII (pp. 46-49).

CHAPTER I. _INTRODUCTORY._ Let us agree that "x_{1}" shall mean "Some existing Things have the Attribute x", i.e. (more briefly) "Some x exist"; also that "xy_{1}" shall mean "Some xy exist", and so on. Such a Proposition may be called an '=Entity=.' [Note that, when there are _two_ letters in the expression, it does not in the least matter which stands _first_: "xy_{1}" and "yx_{1}" mean exactly the same.] Also that "x_{0}" shall mean "No existing Things have the Attribute x", i.e. (more briefly) "No x exist"; also that "xy_{0}" shall mean "No xy exist", and so on. Such a Proposition may be called a '=Nullity='. Also that "+" shall mean "and". [Thus "ab_{1} + cd_{0}" means "Some ab exist and no cd exist".] Also that ">" shall mean "would, if true, prove". [Thus, "x_{0} > xy_{0}" means "The Proposition 'No x exist' would, if true, prove the Proposition 'No xy exist'".] When two Letters are both of them accented, or both _not_ accented, they are said to have '=Like Signs=', or to be '=Like=': when one is accented, and the other not, they are said to have '=Unlike Signs=', or to be '=Unlike='. pg071 CHAPTER II. _REPRESENTATION OF PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION._ Let us take, first, the Proposition "Some x are y". This, we know, is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence "Some xy exist". (See p. 31.) Hence it may be represented by the expression "xy_{1}". The Converse Proposition "Some y are x" may of course be represented by the _same_ expression, viz. "xy_{1}". Similarly we may represent the three similar Pairs of Converse Propositions, viz.--
