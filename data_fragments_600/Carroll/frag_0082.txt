Work Examples Sec. =1=, 17-21 (p. 97); Sec. =4=, 1-6 (p. 100); Sec. =5=, 1-6 (p. 101).] pg066 Sec. 3. _Given a Trio of Propositions of Relation, of which every two contain a Pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as a Syllogism; to ascertain whether the proposed Conclusion is consequent from the proposed Premisses, and, if so, whether it is complete._ The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:-- (1) Take the proposed Premisses, and ascertain, by the process described at p. 60, what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them. (2) If there be _no_ Conclusion, say so. (3) If there _be_ a Conclusion, compare it with the proposed Conclusion, and pronounce accordingly. I will now work out, in their briefest form, as models for the Reader to imitate in working examples, six Problems. (1) "All soldiers are strong; All soldiers are brave. Some strong men are brave." Univ. "men"; m = soldiers; x = strong; y = brave. pg067 .---------------. .-------. "All m are x; | | | |(I)| | All m are y. | .---|---. | |---|---| Some x are y." | |(I)|(O)| | | | | |---|---|---|---| .-------. | |(O)|(O)| | | .---|---. | .'. "Some x are y." | | | .---------------. Hence proposed Conclusion is right. (2) "I admire these pictures; When I admire anything I wish to examine it thoroughly. I wish to examine some of these pictures thoroughly." Univ. "things"; m = admired by me; x = these pictures; y = things which I wish to examine thoroughly. .---------------. .-------. "All x are m; |(O) | (O)| |(I)|(O)| All m are y. | .---|---. | |---|---| Some x are y." | |(I)|(O)| | | | | |---|---|---|---| .-------. | | |(O)| | | .---|---. | .'. "All x are y." | | | .---------------. Hence proposed Conclusion is _incomplete_, the _complete_ one being "I wish to examine _all_ these pictures thoroughly". (3) "None but the brave deserve the fair; Some braggarts are cowards. Some braggarts do not deserve the fair." Univ. "persons"; m = brave; x = deserving of the fair; y = braggarts. .---------------. .-------. "No m' are x; |(O) | (O)| | | | Some y are m'. | .---|---. | |---|---| Some y are x'." | | | | | |(I)| | |---|---|---|---| .-------. | | | | | | .---|---. | .'. "Some y are x'." |(I) | | .---------------. Hence proposed Conclusion is right. pg068 (4) "All soldiers can march; Some babies are not soldiers. Some babies cannot march". Univ. "persons"; m = soldiers; x = able to march; y = babies. .---------------. "All m are x; | | | Some y are m'. | .---|---. | Some y are x'." | | (I) | | |(I)|---|---|---| | |(O)|(O)| | | .---|---. | There is no | | | Conclusion. .---------------. (5) "All selfish men are unpopular; All obliging men are popular. All obliging men are unselfish". Univ. "men"; m = popular; x = selfish; y = obliging. .---------------. .-------. "All x are m'; |(O) | (I)| |(O)|(I)| All y are m. | .---|---. | |---|---| All y are x'." | |(O)|(O)| | |(I)| | |---|---|---|---| .-------. | |(I)| | | | .---|---. | .'.
