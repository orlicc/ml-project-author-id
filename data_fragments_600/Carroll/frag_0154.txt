To assist the reader, page markers in the forms "pg-ix", "pg193" & "px-3" have been included in the right margin at points corresponding closely to the tops of the original pages. These may be searched for to locate the material referred to. In the main section, these page markers are always given with 3 digits including, if necessary, leading zeroes. This book contains a large number of line drawn illustrations which are un-credited. As these cannot be rendered here in the original manner they have been reproduced as well as possible in the manner known as "ASCII art". In this ASCII file, the greater-than symbol (>) has bee substituted for the Pilcrow symbol. A number of transcription errors were found in the original book. As these were clearly not part of the Author's intention they have, as far as possible, been identified and corrected in accordance with the methods given by the Author. These corrections are listed here below with their locations and original text. In these notes the word 'natural' identifies a letter symbol occurring without a prime mark.
