Method of Diagrams._ The first Premiss asserts that no xm exist: so we mark the xm-Compartment as empty, by placing a 'O' in each of its Cells. The second asserts that some my' exist: so we mark the my'-Compartment as occupied, by placing a 'I' in its only available Cell. .---------------. | | | | .---|---. | | |(O)|(O)| | |---|---|---|---| | | |(I)| | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------. The only information, that this gives us as to x and y, is that the x'y'-Compartment is _occupied_, i.e. that some x'y' exist. Hence "Some x' are y'": i.e. "Some persons, who are not philosophers, are not gamblers". (6) _Solution by my Method of Subscripts._ xm_{0} + my'_{1} > x'y'_{1} i.e. "Some persons, who are not philosophers, are not gamblers." Sec. 9. _My Method of treating Syllogisms and Sorites._ Of all the strange things, that are to be met with in the ordinary text-books of Formal Logic, perhaps the strangest is the violent contrast one finds to exist between their ways of dealing with these two subjects. While they have elaborately discussed no less than _nineteen_ different forms of _Syllogisms_----each with its own special and exasperating Rules, while the whole constitute an almost useless machine, for practical purposes, many of the Conclusions being incomplete, and many quite legitimate forms being ignored----they have limited _Sorites_ to _two_ forms only, of childish simplicity; and these they have dignified with special _names_, apparently under the impression that no other possible forms existed! As to _Syllogisms_, I find that their nineteen forms, with about a score of others which they have ignored, can all be arranged under _three_ forms, each with a very simple Rule of its own; and the only question the Reader has to settle, in working any one of the 101 Examples given at p. 101 of this book, is "Does it belong to Fig. I., II., or III.?" pg184 As to _Sorites_, the only two forms, recognised by the text-books, are the _Aristotelian_, whose Premisses are a series of Propositions in A, so arranged that the Predicate of each is the Subject of the next, and the _Goclenian_, whose Premisses are the very same series, written backwards. Goclenius, it seems, was the first who noticed the startling fact that it does not affect the force of a Syllogism to invert the order of its Premisses, and who applied this discovery to a Sorites. If we assume (as surely we may?) that he is the _same_ man as that transcendent genius who first noticed that 4 times 5 is the same thing as 5 times 4, we may apply to him what somebody (Edmund Yates, I think it was) has said of Tupper, viz., "here is a man who, beyond all others of his generation, has been favoured with Glimpses of the Obvious!" These puerile----not to say infantine----forms of a Sorites I have, in this book, ignored from the very first, and have not only admitted freely Propositions in _E_, but have purposely stated the Premisses in random order, leaving to the Reader the useful task of arranging them, for himself, in an order which can be worked as a series of regular Syllogisms. In doing this, he can begin with _any one_ of them he likes. I have tabulated, for curiosity, the various orders in which the Premisses of the Aristotelian Sorites 1. All a are b; 2. All b are c; 3. All c are d; 4. All d are e; 5. All e are h. .'. All a are h. may be syllogistically arranged, and I
