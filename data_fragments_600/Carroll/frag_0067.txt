represent the three similar Trios of equivalent Propositions; the whole Set of _four_ Trios being as follows:-- (1) "No xy exist" = "No x are y" = "No y are x". (2) "No xy' exist" = "No x are y'" = "No y' are x". (3) "No x'y exist" = "No x' are y" = "No y are x'". (4) "No x'y' exist" = "No x' are y'" = "No y' are x'". Let us take, next, the Proposition "All x are y". We know (see p. 17) that this is a _Double_ Proposition, and equivalent to the _two_ Propositions "Some x are y" and "No x are y'", each of which we already know how to represent. .-------. |(.)|( )| |---|---| | | | .-------. [Note that the _Subject_ of the given Proposition settles which _Half_ we are to use; and that its _Predicate_ settles in which _portion_ of that Half we are to place the Red Counter.] pg034 TABLE II. .-----------------------------------------------------. | | .-------. | | .-------. | | | | (.) | | | |( )|( )| | | Some x exist | |---|---| | No x exist | |---|---| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | .-------. | | .-------. | |---------------|-----------|-------------|-----------| | | .-------. | | .-------. | | | | | | | | | | | | | Some x' exist | |---|---| | No x' exist | |---|---| | | | | (.) | | | |( )|( )| | | | .-------. | | .-------. | |---------------|-----------|-------------|-----------| | | .-------. | | .-------. | | | | | | | | |( )| | | | Some y exist | |(.)|---| | No y exist | |---|---| | | | | | | | | |( )| | | | | .-------. | | .-------. | |---------------|-----------|-------------|-----------| | | .-------. | | .-------. | | | | | | | | | |( )| | | Some y' exist | |---|(.)| | No y' exist | |---|---| | | | | | | | | | |( )| | | | .-------. | | .-------. | .-----------------------------------------------------. Similarly we may represent the seven similar Propositions "All x are y'", "All x' are y", "All x' are y'", "All y are x", "All y are x'", "All y' are x", and "All y' are x'". Let us take, lastly, the Double Proposition "Some x are y and some are y'", each part of which we already know how to represent. .-------. |(.)|(.)| |---|---| | | | .-------. Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions, "Some x' are y and some are y'", "Some y are x and some are x'", "Some y' are x and some are x'". The Reader should now get his genial friend to question him, severely, on these two Tables. The _Inquisitor_ should have the Tables before him: but the _Victim_ should have nothing but a blank Diagram, and the Counters with which he is to represent the various Propositions named by his friend, e.g. "Some y exist", "No y' are x", "All x are y", &c. &c. pg035 TABLE III. .-------------------------------------------------------------. | | .-------. | | .-------. | | Some xy exist | |(.)| | | | |(.)|( )| | | = Some x are y | |---|---| | All x are y | |---|---| | | = Some y are x | | | | | | | | | | | | .-------. | | .-------. | |------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------| | | .-------. | | .-------. | | Some
