grateful for the loan of a skipping-rope." (4) Let Univ. be "puppies." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "all." (6) The Proposition now becomes "All | lame puppies | are | puppies not grateful for the loan of a skipping-rope." pg015 (5) "No one takes in the _Times_, unless he is well-educated." (1) The Subject is evidently persons who are not well-educated ("no _one_" evidently means "no _person_"). (2) The Verb is "takes in," for which we may substitute the phrase "are persons taking in." (3) The Predicate is "persons taking in the _Times_." (4) Let Univ. be "persons." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "no." (6) The Proposition now becomes "No | persons who are not well-educated | are | persons taking in the _Times_." (6) "My carriage will meet you at the station." (1) The Subject is "my carriage." This, being an 'Individual,' is equivalent to the Class "my carriages." (Note that this Class contains only _one_ Member.) (2) The Verb is "will meet", for which we may substitute the phrase "are * * * that will meet." (3) The Predicate is "* * * that will meet you at the station." (4) Let Univ. be "things." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "all." (6) The Proposition now becomes "All | my carriages | are | things that will meet you at the station." (7) "Happy is the man who does not know what 'toothache' means!" (1) The Subject is evidently "the man &c." (Note that in this sentence, the _Predicate_ comes first.) At first sight, the Subject seems to be an '_Individual_'; but on further consideration, we see that the article "the" does _not_ imply that there is only _one_ such man. Hence the phrase "the man who" is equivalent to "all men who". (2) The Verb is "are." (3) The Predicate is "happy * * *." (4) Let Univ. be "men." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "all." (6) The Proposition now becomes "All | men who do not know what 'toothache' means | are | happy men." pg016 (8) "Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be." (1) The Subject is "farmers." (2) The Verb is "grumble," for which we substitute the phrase "are * * * who grumble." (3) The Predicate is "* * * who always grumble &c." (4) Let Univ. be "persons." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "some." (6) The Proposition now becomes "Some | farmers | are | persons who always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be." (9) "No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars." (1) The Subject is "lambs." (2) The Verb is "are." (3) The Predicate is "* * * accustomed &c." (4) Let Univ. be "animals." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "no." (6) The Proposition now becomes "No | lambs | are | animals accustomed to smoke cigars." (10) "I ca'n't understand examples that are not arranged in regular order, like those I am used to." (1) The Subject is "examples that," &c. (2) The Verb is "I ca'n't understand," which we must alter, so as to have "examples," instead of "I," as the nominative case. It may be expressed as "are not understood by me." (3) The Predicate is "* * * not understood by me." (4) Let Univ. be "examples." (5) The Sign of Quantity is "all." (6) The Proposition now becomes "All | examples that are not arranged in regular order like those I am used to | are | examples not understood by me."] pg017 Sec. 3. _A Proposition of Relation, beginning with "All", is a Double
