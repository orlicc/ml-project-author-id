to imprisonment, were also sentenced to hard labour". Let Univ. be "the prisoners who were put on their trial at the last Assizes"; m = who were sentenced to imprisonment; x = against whom the verdict 'guilty' was returned; y = who were sentenced to hard labour. The Premisses, translated into abstract form, are "All x are m; Some m are y". Breaking up the first, we get the three (1) "Some x are m; (2) No x are m'; (3) Some m are y". Representing these, in the order 2, 1, 3, on a Triliteral Diagram, we get .---------------. |(O) | (O)| | .---|---. | | | (I) | | |---|(I)|---|---| | | | | | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------. Here we get no Conclusion at all. You would very likely have guessed, if you had seen _only_ the Premisses, that the Conclusion would be "Some, against whom the verdict 'guilty' was returned, were sentenced to hard labour". But this Conclusion is not even _true_, with regard to the Assizes I have here invented. "Not _true!_" you exclaim. "Then who _were_ they, who were sentenced to imprisonment and were also sentenced to hard labour? They _must_ have had the verdict 'guilty' returned against them, or how could they be sentenced?" Well, it happened like _this_, you see. They were three ruffians, who had committed highway-robbery. When they were put on their trial, they _pleaded_ 'guilty'. So no _verdict_ was returned at all; and they were sentenced at once.] I will now work out, in their briefest form, as models for the Reader to imitate in working examples, the above four concrete Problems. pg064 (1) [see p. 60] "No son of mine is dishonest; People always treat an honest man with respect." Univ. "men"; m = honest; x = my sons; y = treated with respect. .---------------. .-------. "No x are m'; |(O) | (O)| | |(O)| All m are y." | .---|---. | |---|---| | | |(O)| | | | | |---|(I)|---|---| .-------. | | |(O)| | | .---|---. | .'. "No x are y'." | | | .---------------. i.e. "No son of mine ever fails to be treated with respect." (2) [see p. 61] "All cats understand French; Some chickens are cats". Univ. "creatures"; m = cats; x = understanding French; y = chickens. .---------------. .-------. "All m are x; | | | |(I)| | Some y are m." | .---|---. | |---|---| | |(I)| | | | | | |---|---|---|---| .-------. | |(O)|(O)| | | .---|---. | .'. "Some y are x." | | | .---------------. i.e. "Some chickens understand French." (3) [see p. 62] "All diligent students are successful; All ignorant students are unsuccessful". Univ. "students"; m = successful; x = diligent; y = ignorant. .---------------. .-------. "All x are m; |(O) | (O)| |(O)|(I)| All y are m'." | .---|---. | |---|---| | |(O)|(I)| | |(I)| | |---|---|---|---| .-------. | |(O)| | | | .---|---. | .'. "All x are y'; |(I) | | All y are x'." .---------------. i.e. "All diligent students are learned; and all ignorant students are idle". pg065 (4) [see p. 63] "Of the prisoners who were put on their trial at the last Assizes, all, against whom the verdict 'guilty' was returned, were sentenced to imprisonment; Some, who were sentenced to imprisonment, were also sentenced to hard labour". Univ. "prisoners who were put on their trial at the last Assizes", m = sentenced to imprisonment; x = against whom the verdict 'guilty' was returned; y = sentenced to hard labour. .---------------. "All x are m; |(O) |
