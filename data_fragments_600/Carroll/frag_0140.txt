For _six_ letters, Mr. Venn suggests that we might use _two_ Diagrams, like the above, one for the f-part, and the other for the not-f-part, of all the other combinations. "This", he says, "would give the desired 64 subdivisions." This, however, would only give 62 closed Compartments, and _one_ infinite area, which the two Classes, a'b'c'd'e'f and a'b'c'd'e'f', would have to share between them. Beyond _six_ letters Mr. Venn does not go. Sec. 7. _My Method of Diagrams._ My Method of Diagrams _resembles_ Mr. Venn's, in having separate Compartments assigned to the various Classes, and in marking these Compartments as _occupied_ or as _empty_; but it _differs_ from his Method, in assigning a _closed_ area to the _Universe of Discourse_, so that the Class which, under Mr. Venn's liberal sway, has been ranging at will through Infinite Space, is suddenly dismayed to find itself "cabin'd, cribb'd, confined", in a limited Cell like any other Class! Also I use _rectilinear_, instead of _curvilinear_, Figures; and I mark an _occupied_ Cell with a 'I' (meaning that there is at least _one_ Thing in it), and an _empty_ Cell with a 'O' (meaning that there is _no_ Thing in it). For _two_ letters, I use this Diagram, in which the North Half is assigned to 'x', the South to 'not-x' (or 'x''), the West to y, and the East to y'. Thus the N.W. Cell contains the xy-Class, the N.E. Cell the xy'-Class, and so on. .-------. | | | |---|---| | | | .-------. For _three_ letters, I subdivide these four Cells, by drawing an _Inner_ Square, which I assign to m, the _Outer_ Border being assigned to m'. I thus get _eight_ Cells that are needed to accommodate the eight Classes, whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are xym, xym', &c. .---------------. | | | | .---|---. | | | | | | |---|---|---|---| | | | | | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------. This last Diagram is the most complex that I use in the _Elementary_ Part of my 'Symbolic Logic.' But I may as well take this opportunity of describing the more complex ones which will appear in Part II. pg177 For _four_ letters (which I call a, b, c, d) I use this Diagram; assigning the North Half to a (and of course the _rest_ of the Diagram to a'), the West Half to b, the Horizontal Oblong to c, and the Upright Oblong to d. We have now got 16 Cells. .---------------------. | | | | .---|---. | | | | | | | .---|---|---|---. | | | | | | | | |--|---|---|---|---|--| | | | | | | | | .---|---|---|---. | | | | | | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------------. For _five_ letters (adding e) I subdivide the 16 Cells of the previous Diagram by _oblique_ partitions, assigning all the _upper_ portions to e, and all the _lower_ portions to e'. Here, I admit, we lose the advantage of having the e-Class all _together_, "in a ring-fence", like the other 4 Classes.
