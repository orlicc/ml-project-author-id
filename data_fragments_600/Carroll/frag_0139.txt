the possible cases), and, for "Some not-x are not-y", all the _four_. Sec. 6. _Venn's Method of Diagrams._ Let us represent "not-x" by "x'". Mr. Venn's Method of Diagrams is a great advance on the above Method. He uses the last of the above Diagrams to represent _any_ desired relation between x and y, by simply shading a Compartment known to be _empty_, and placing a + in one known to be _occupied_. Thus, he would represent the three Propositions "Some x are y", "No x are y", and "All x are y", as follows:-- _____ _____ _/ \_/ \_ / / \ \ | | + | | \_ \_/ _/ \_____/ \_____/ _____ _____ _/ \_/ \_ / /#\ \ | |###| | \_ \#/ _/ \_____/ \_____/ _____ _____ _/#####\_/ \_ /#######/ \ \ |#######| + | | \#######\_/ _/ \#####/ \_____/ pg175 It will be seen that, of the _four_ Classes, whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are xy, xy', x'y, and x'y', only _three_ are here provided with closed Compartments, while the _fourth_ is allowed the rest of the Infinite Plane to range about in! This arrangement would involve us in very serious trouble, if we ever attempted to represent "No x' are y'." Mr. Venn _once_ (at p. 281) encounters this awful task; but evades it, in a quite masterly fashion, by the simple foot-note "We have not troubled to shade the outside of this diagram"! To represent _two_ Propositions (containing a common Term) _together_, a _three_-letter Diagram is needed. This is the one used by Mr. Venn. _____ _/ \_ _/___ x ___\_ _/| \_/ |\_ / \_ / \ _/ \ | \|___|/ | \_ m \_/ y _/ \_____/ \_____/ Here, again, we have only _seven_ closed Compartments, to accommodate the _eight_ Classes whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are xym, xym', &c. "With four terms in request," Mr. Venn says, "the most simple and symmetrical diagram seems to me that produced by making four ellipses intersect one another in the desired manner". This, however, provides only _fifteen_ closed compartments. b ____ ____ c / \ / \ a ___/___ \/ ___\___ d / \ \ /\ / / \ / \ \/ \/ / \ \ \ /\ /\ / / \ \/ \/ \/ / \ /\ /\ /\ / \ \ \/ \/ / / \ \/\ /\/ / \ /\_\/_/\ / \__\______/__/ For _five_ letters, "the simplest diagram I can suggest," Mr. Venn says, "is one like this (the small ellipse in the centre is to be regarded as a portion of the _outside_ of c; i.e. its four component portions are inside b and d but are no part of c). It must be admitted that such a diagram is not quite so simple to draw as one might wish it to be; but then consider what the alternative is of one undertakes to deal with five terms and all their combinations--nothing short of the disagreeable task of writing out, or in some way putting before us, all the 32 combinations involved." b c d ______ ____ ______ ______/_ \/ \/ _\______ a / / \ /\ /\ / \ \ e / / \ / \ / \ / \ \ / \ \/ \/ \/ / \ / \ /\ /\ /\ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ | \/ \/ __ \/ \/ | | /\ /\/ \/\ /\ | | / \ / /\ /\ \ / \ | | | \/ | \/ | \/ | |
