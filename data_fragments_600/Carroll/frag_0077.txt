to dispense with the Biliteral Diagram, and to read off the result from the Triliteral Diagram itself. To _transfer_ the information, observe the following Rules:-- (1) Examine the N.W. Quarter of the Triliteral Diagram. (2) If it contains a "I", in _either_ Cell, it is certainly _occupied_, and you may mark the N.W. Quarter of the Biliteral Diagram with a "I". (3) If it contains _two_ "O"s, one in _each_ Cell, it is certainly _empty_, and you may mark the N.W. Quarter of the Biliteral Diagram with a "O". pg054 (4) Deal in the same way with the N.E., the S.W., and the S.E. Quarter. [Let us take, as examples, the results of the four Examples worked in the previous Chapters. (1) .---------------. |(O) | (O)| | .---|---. | | | |(O)| | |---|---|---|---| | | |(O)| | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------. In the N.W. Quarter, only _one_ of the two Cells is marked as _empty_: so we do not know whether the N.W. Quarter of the Biliteral Diagram is _occupied_ or _empty_: so we cannot mark it. .-------. | |(O)| |---|---| | | | .-------. In the N.E. Quarter, we find _two_ "O"s: so _this_ Quarter is certainly _empty_; and we mark it so on the Biliteral Diagram. In the S.W. Quarter, we have no information _at all_. In the S.E. Quarter, we have not enough to use. We may read off the result as "No x are y'", or "No y' are x," whichever we prefer. (2) .---------------. | | | | .---|---. | | |(O)|(I)| | |---|---|---|---| | |(O)| | | | .---|---. | | | | .---------------. In the N.W. Quarter, we have not enough information to use. In the N.E. Quarter, we find a "I". This shows us that it is _occupied_: so we may mark the N.E. Quarter on the Biliteral Diagram with a "I". .-------. | |(I)| |---|---| | | | .-------. In the S.W. Quarter, we have not enough information to use. In the S.E. Quarter, we have none at all. We may read off the result as "Some x are y'", or "Some y' are x", whichever we prefer. pg055 (3) .---------------. | | | | .---|---. | | | |(O)| | |---|(I)|---|---| | | |(O)| | | .---|---. | |(O) | (O)| .---------------. In the N.W. Quarter, we have _no_ information. (The "I", sitting on the fence, is of no use to us until we know on _which_ side he means to jump down!) In the N.E. Quarter, we have not enough information to use. Neither have we in the S.W. Quarter. .-------. | | | |---|---| | |(O)| .-------. The S.E. Quarter is the only one that yields enough information to use. It is certainly _empty_: so we mark it as such on the Biliteral Diagram. We may read off the results as "No x' are y'", or "No y' are x'", whichever we prefer. (4) .---------------. |(O) | | | .---|---. | | |(I)| | | |---|---|---|---| | |(O)|(O)| | | .---|---. | |(O) | | .---------------. The N.W. Quarter is _occupied_, in spite of the "O" in the Outer Cell. So we mark it with a "I" on the Biliteral Diagram. The N.E. Quarter yields no information. .-------. |(I)| | |---|---| | | | .-------. The S.W. Quarter is certainly _empty_. So we mark it as such on the Biliteral Diagram. .-------. |(I)| | |---|---| |(O)| | .-------. The S.E. Quarter does not yield enough information to use. We read off the result as "All y are x."] [Review Tables V, VI (pp. 46,
