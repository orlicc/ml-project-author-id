One of the favourite objections, brought against the Science of Logic by its detractors, is that a Syllogism has no real validity as an argument, since it involves the Fallacy of _Petitio Principii_ (i.e. "Begging the Question", the essence of which is that the whole Conclusion is involved in _one_ of the Premisses). This formidable objection is refuted, with beautiful clearness and simplicity, by these three Diagrams, which show us that, in each of the three Figures, the Conclusion is really involved in the _two_ Premisses taken together, each contributing its share. Thus, in Fig. I., the Premiss xm_{0} empties the _Inner_ Cell of the N.W. Quarter, while the Premiss ym_{0} empties its _Outer_ Cell. Hence it needs the _two_ Premisses to empty the _whole_ of the N.W. Quarter, and thus to prove the Conclusion xy_{0}. Again, in Fig. II., the Premiss xm_{0} empties the Inner Cell of the N.W. Quarter. The Premiss ym_{1} merely tells us that the Inner Portion of the W. Half is _occupied_, so that we may place a 'I' in it, _somewhere_; but, if this were the _whole_ of our information, we should not know in _which_ Cell to place it, so that it would have to 'sit on the fence': it is only when we learn, from the other Premiss, that the _upper_ of these two Cells is _empty_, that we feel authorised to place the 'I' in the _lower_ Cell, and thus to prove the Conclusion x'y_{1}. Lastly, in Fig. III., the information, that m _exists_, merely authorises us to place a 'I' _somewhere_ in the Inner Square----but it has large choice of fences to sit upon! It needs the Premiss xm_{0} to drive it out of the N. Half of that Square; and it needs the Premiss ym_{0} to drive it out of the W. Half. Hence it needs the _two_ Premisses to drive it into the Inner Portion of the S.E. Quarter, and thus to prove the Conclusion x'y'_{1}. pg165 APPENDIX, ADDRESSED TO TEACHERS. Sec. 1. _Introductory._ There are several matters, too hard to discuss with _Learners_, which nevertheless need to be explained to any _Teachers_, into whose hands this book may fall, in order that they may thoroughly understand what my Symbolic Method _is_, and in what respects it differs from the many other Methods already published. These matters are as follows:-- The "Existential Import" of Propositions. The use of "is-not" (or "are-not") as a Copula. The theory "two Negative Premisses prove nothing." Euler's Method of Diagrams. Venn's Method of Diagrams. My Method of Diagrams. The Solution of a Syllogism by various Methods. My Method of treating Syllogisms and Sorites. Some account of Parts II, III. Sec. 2. _The "Existential Import" of Propositions._ The writers, and editors, of the Logical text-books which run in the ordinary grooves----to whom I shall hereafter refer by the (I hope inoffensive) title "The Logicians"----take, on this subject, what seems to me to be a more humble position than is at all necessary. They speak of the Copula of a Proposition "with bated breath", almost as if it were a living, conscious Entity, capable of declaring for itself what it chose to mean, and that we, poor human creatures, had nothing to do but to ascertain _what_ was its sovereign will and pleasure, and submit to it. pg166 In
